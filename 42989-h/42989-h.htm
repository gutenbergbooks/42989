<h2><a name="THE_PLATTNER_STORY" id="THE_PLATTNER_STORY">THE PLATTNER STORY</a></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Whether</span> the story of Gottfried Plattner is
to be credited or not, is a pretty question
in the value of evidence. On the one hand,
we have seven witnesses&mdash;to be perfectly exact, we
have six and a half pairs of eyes, and one undeniable
fact; and on the other we have&mdash;what is it?&mdash;prejudice,
common sense, the inertia of opinion.
Never were there seven more honest-seeming witnesses;
never was there a more undeniable fact than
the inversion of Gottfried Plattner&rsquo;s anatomical structure,
and&mdash;never was there a more preposterous
story than the one they have to tell! The most
preposterous part of the story is the worthy Gottfried&rsquo;s
contribution (for I count him as one of the
seven). Heaven forbid that I should be led into
giving countenance to superstition by a passion for
impartiality, and so come to share the fate of
Eusapia&rsquo;s patrons! Frankly, I believe there is
something crooked about this business of Gottfried
Plattner; but what that crooked factor is, I will
admit as frankly, I do not know. I have been
surprised at the credit accorded to the story in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
most unexpected and authoritative quarters. The
fairest way to the reader, however, will be for me
to tell it without further comment.</p>

<p>Gottfried Plattner is, in spite of his name, a free-born
Englishman. His father was an Alsatian who
came to England in the Sixties, married a respectable
English girl of unexceptionable antecedents, and died,
after a wholesome and uneventful life (devoted, I
understand, chiefly to the laying of parquet flooring),
in 1887. Gottfried&rsquo;s age is seven-and-twenty. He
is, by virtue of his heritage of three languages,
Modern Languages Master in a small private school
in the South of England. To the casual observer
he is singularly like any other Modern Languages
Master in any other small private school. His
costume is neither very costly nor very fashionable,
but, on the other hand, it is not markedly cheap
or shabby; his complexion, like his height and his
bearing, is inconspicuous. You would notice, perhaps,
that, like the majority of people, his face was not
absolutely symmetrical, his right eye a little larger
than the left, and his jaw a trifle heavier on the right
side. If you, as an ordinary careless person, were to
bare his chest and feel his heart beating, you would
probably find it quite like the heart of anyone else.
But here you and the trained observer would part
company. If you found his heart quite ordinary, the
trained observer would find it quite otherwise. And
once the thing was pointed out to you, you too would
perceive the peculiarity easily enough. It is that
Gottfried&rsquo;s heart beats on the right side of his
body.</p>

<p>Now, that is not the only singularity of Gottfried&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
structure, although it is the only one that would
appeal to the untrained mind. Careful sounding of
Gottfried&rsquo;s internal arrangements, by a well-known
surgeon, seems to point to the fact that all the other
unsymmetrical parts of his body are similarly misplaced.
The right lobe of his liver is on the left
side, the left on his right; while his lungs, too, are
similarly contraposed. What is still more singular,
unless Gottfried is a consummate actor, we must
believe that his right hand has recently become his
left. Since the occurrences we are about to consider
(as impartially as possible), he has found the utmost
difficulty in writing, except from right to left across
the paper with his left hand. He cannot throw with
his right hand, he is perplexed at meal times between
knife and fork, and his ideas of the rule of the road&mdash;he
is a cyclist&mdash;are still a dangerous confusion.
And there is not a scrap of evidence to show that
before these occurrences Gottfried was at all left-handed.</p>

<p>There is yet another wonderful fact in this
preposterous business. Gottfried produces three
photographs of himself. You have him at the age
of five or six, thrusting fat legs at you from under
a plaid frock, and scowling. In that photograph
his left eye is a little larger than his right, and his
jaw is a trifle heavier on the left side. This is the
reverse of his present living conditions. The photograph
of Gottfried at fourteen seems to contradict
these facts, but that is because it is one of those
cheap &ldquo;Gem&rdquo; photographs that were then in vogue,
taken direct upon metal, and therefore reversing
things just as a looking-glass would. The third<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
photograph represents him at one-and-twenty, and
confirms the record of the others. There seems here
evidence of the strongest confirmatory character that
Gottfried has exchanged his left side for his right.
Yet how a human being can be so changed, short of
a fantastic and pointless miracle, it is exceedingly
hard to suggest.</p>

<p>In one way, of course, these facts might be
explicable on the supposition that Plattner has
undertaken an elaborate mystification, on the
strength of his heart&rsquo;s displacement. Photographs
may be fudged, and left-handedness imitated. But
the character of the man does not lend itself to any
such theory. He is quiet, practical, unobtrusive,
and thoroughly sane, from the Nordau standpoint.
He likes beer, and smokes moderately, takes walking
exercise daily, and has a healthily high estimate of
the value of his teaching. He has a good but
untrained tenor voice, and takes a pleasure in singing
airs of a popular and cheerful character. He is fond,
but not morbidly fond, of reading,&mdash;chiefly fiction
pervaded with a vaguely pious optimism,&mdash;sleeps
well, and rarely dreams. He is, in fact, the very
last person to evolve a fantastic fable. Indeed, so
far from forcing this story upon the world, he has
been singularly reticent on the matter. He meets
inquirers with a certain engaging&mdash;bashfulness is
almost the word, that disarms the most suspicious.
He seems genuinely ashamed that anything so
unusual has occurred to him.</p>

<p>It is to be regretted that Plattner&rsquo;s aversion to
the idea of post-mortem dissection may postpone,
perhaps for ever, the positive proof that his entire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
body has had its left and right sides transposed.
Upon that fact mainly the credibility of his story
hangs. There is no way of taking a man and
moving him about <em>in space</em>, as ordinary people
understand space, that will result in our changing
his sides. Whatever you do, his right is still his
right, his left his left. You can do that with a
perfectly thin and flat thing, of course. If you were
to cut a figure out of paper, any figure with a right
and left side, you could change its sides simply by
lifting it up and turning it over. But with a solid
it is different. Mathematical theorists tell us that
the only way in which the right and left sides of a
solid body can be changed is by taking that body
clean out of space as we know it,&mdash;taking it out of
ordinary existence, that is, and turning it somewhere
outside space. This is a little abstruse, no doubt,
but anyone with any knowledge of mathematical
theory will assure the reader of its truth. To put
the thing in technical language, the curious inversion
of Plattner&rsquo;s right and left sides is proof that he has
moved out of our space into what is called the
Fourth Dimension, and that he has returned again
to our world. Unless we choose to consider ourselves
the victims of an elaborate and motiveless fabrication,
we are almost bound to believe that this has occurred.</p>

<p>So much for the tangible facts. We come now
to the account of the phenomena that attended his
temporary disappearance from the world. It appears
that in the Sussexville Proprietary School, Plattner
not only discharged the duties of Modern Languages
Master, but also taught chemistry, commercial geography,
book-keeping, shorthand, drawing, and any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
other additional subject to which the changing
fancies of the boys&rsquo; parents might direct attention.
He knew little or nothing of these various subjects,
but in secondary as distinguished from Board or
elementary schools, knowledge in the teacher is, very
properly, by no means so necessary as high moral
character and gentlemanly tone. In chemistry he
was particularly deficient, knowing, he says, nothing
beyond the Three Gases (whatever the three gases
may be). As, however, his pupils began by knowing
nothing, and derived all their information from him,
this caused him (or anyone) but little inconvenience
for several terms. Then a little boy named Whibble
joined the school, who had been educated (it seems)
by some mischievous relative into an inquiring habit
of mind. This little boy followed Plattner&rsquo;s lessons
with marked and sustained interest, and in order to
exhibit his zeal on the subject, brought, at various
times, substances for Plattner to analyse. Plattner,
flattered by this evidence of his power of awakening
interest, and trusting to the boy&rsquo;s ignorance, analysed
these, and even made general statements as to their
composition. Indeed, he was so far stimulated by
his pupil as to obtain a work upon analytical
chemistry, and study it during his supervision of the
evening&rsquo;s preparation. He was surprised to find
chemistry quite an interesting subject.</p>

<p>So far the story is absolutely commonplace. But
now the greenish powder comes upon the scene.
The source of that greenish powder seems, unfortunately,
lost. Master Whibble tells a tortuous
story of finding it done up in a packet in a disused
limekiln near the Downs. It would have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
an excellent thing for Plattner, and possibly for
Master Whibble&rsquo;s family, if a match could have
been applied to that powder there and then. The
young gentleman certainly did not bring it to school
in a packet, but in a common eight-ounce graduated
medicine bottle, plugged with masticated newspaper.
He gave it to Plattner at the end of the afternoon
school. Four boys had been detained after school
prayers in order to complete some neglected tasks,
and Plattner was supervising these in the small
classroom in which the chemical teaching was conducted.
The appliances for the practical teaching
of chemistry in the Sussexville Proprietary School,
as in most small schools in this country, are characterised
by a severe simplicity. They are kept in
a small cupboard standing in a recess, and having
about the same capacity as a common travelling
trunk. Plattner, being bored with his passive superintendence,
seems to have welcomed the intervention
of Whibble with his green powder as an agreeable
diversion, and, unlocking this cupboard, proceeded
at once with his analytical experiments. Whibble
sat, luckily for himself, at a safe distance, regarding
him. The four malefactors, feigning a profound
absorption in their work, watched him furtively with
the keenest interest. For even within the limits of
the Three Gases, Plattner&rsquo;s practical chemistry was,
I understand, temerarious.</p>

<p>They are practically unanimous in their account
of Plattner&rsquo;s proceedings. He poured a little of the
green powder into a test-tube, and tried the substance
with water, hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, and sulphuric
acid in succession. Getting no result, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
emptied out a little heap&mdash;nearly half the bottleful,
in fact&mdash;upon a slate and tried a match. He held
the medicine bottle in his left hand. The stuff
began to smoke and melt, and then&mdash;exploded with
deafening violence and a blinding flash.</p>

<p>The five boys, seeing the flash and being prepared
for catastrophes, ducked below their desks, and were
none of them seriously hurt. The window was blown
out into the playground, and the blackboard on its
easel was upset. The slate was smashed to atoms.
Some plaster fell from the ceiling. No other damage
was done to the school edifice or appliances, and the
boys at first, seeing nothing of Plattner, fancied he
was knocked down and lying out of their sight
below the desks. They jumped out of their places
to go to his assistance, and were amazed to find the
space empty. Being still confused by the sudden
violence of the report, they hurried to the open door,
under the impression that he must have been hurt,
and have rushed out of the room. But Carson, the
foremost, nearly collided in the doorway with the
principal, Mr. Lidgett.</p>

<p>Mr. Lidgett is a corpulent, excitable man with one
eye. The boys describe him as stumbling into the
room mouthing some of those tempered expletives
irritable schoolmasters accustom themselves to use&mdash;lest
worse befall. &ldquo;Wretched mumchancer!&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Mr. Plattner?&rdquo; The boys are
agreed on the very words. (&ldquo;Wobbler,&rdquo; &ldquo;snivelling
puppy,&rdquo; and &ldquo;mumchancer&rdquo; are, it seems, among the
ordinary small change of Mr. Lidgett&rsquo;s scholastic
commerce.)</p>

<p>Where&rsquo;s Mr. Plattner? That was a question that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
was to be repeated many times in the next few days.
It really seemed as though that frantic hyperbole,
&ldquo;blown to atoms,&rdquo; had for once realised itself. There
was not a visible particle of Plattner to be seen; not
a drop of blood nor a stitch of clothing to be found.
Apparently he had been blown clean out of existence
and left not a wrack behind. Not so much as would
cover a sixpenny piece, to quote a proverbial expression!
The evidence of his absolute disappearance,
as a consequence of that explosion, is indubitable.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to enlarge here upon the commotion
excited in the Sussexville Proprietary School,
and in Sussexville and elsewhere, by this event. It
is quite possible, indeed, that some of the readers of
these pages may recall the hearing of some remote
and dying version of that excitement during the last
summer holidays. Lidgett, it would seem, did
everything in his power to suppress and minimise
the story. He instituted a penalty of twenty-five
lines for any mention of Plattner&rsquo;s name among the
boys, and stated in the schoolroom that he was
clearly aware of his assistant&rsquo;s whereabouts. He
was afraid, he explains, that the possibility of an
explosion happening, in spite of the elaborate precautions
taken to minimise the practical teaching
of chemistry, might injure the reputation of the
school; and so might any mysterious quality in
Plattner&rsquo;s departure. Indeed, he did everything in
his power to make the occurrence seem as ordinary
as possible. In particular, he cross-examined the
five eye-witnesses of the occurrence so searchingly
that they began to doubt the plain evidence of their
senses. But, in spite of these efforts, the tale, in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
magnified and distorted state, made a nine days&rsquo;
wonder in the district, and several parents withdrew
their sons on colourable pretexts. Not the least
remarkable point in the matter is the fact that a
large number of people in the neighbourhood
dreamed singularly vivid dreams of Plattner during
the period of excitement before his return, and that
these dreams had a curious uniformity. In almost
all of them Plattner was seen, sometimes singly,
sometimes in company, wandering about through a
coruscating iridescence. In all cases his face was
pale and distressed, and in some he gesticulated
towards the dreamer. One or two of the boys,
evidently under the influence of nightmare, fancied
that Plattner approached them with remarkable
swiftness, and seemed to look closely into their very
eyes. Others fled with Plattner from the pursuit of
vague and extraordinary creatures of a globular
shape. But all these fancies were forgotten in
inquiries and speculations when, on the Wednesday
next but one after the Monday of the explosion,
Plattner returned.</p>

<p>The circumstances of his return were as singular
as those of his departure. So far as Mr. Lidgett&rsquo;s
somewhat choleric outline can be filled in from
Plattner&rsquo;s hesitating statements, it would appear
that on Wednesday evening, towards the hour of
sunset, the former gentleman, having dismissed evening
preparation, was engaged in his garden, picking
and eating strawberries, a fruit of which he is inordinately
fond. It is a large old-fashioned garden,
secured from observation, fortunately, by a high and
ivy-covered red-brick wall. Just as he was stooping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
over a particularly prolific plant, there was a flash
in the air and a heavy thud, and before he could
look round, some heavy body struck him violently
from behind. He was pitched forward, crushing
the strawberries he held in his hand, and that so
roughly, that his silk hat&mdash;Mr. Lidgett adheres to
the older ideas of scholastic costume&mdash;was driven
violently down upon his forehead, and almost over
one eye. This heavy missile, which slid over him
sideways and collapsed into a sitting posture among
the strawberry plants, proved to be our long-lost Mr.
Gottfried Plattner, in an extremely dishevelled condition.
He was collarless and hatless, his linen was
dirty, and there was blood upon his hands. Mr.
Lidgett was so indignant and surprised that he
remained on all-fours, and with his hat jammed
down on his eye, while he expostulated vehemently
with Plattner for his disrespectful and unaccountable
conduct.</p>

<p>This scarcely idyllic scene completes what I may
call the exterior version of the Plattner story&mdash;its
exoteric aspect. It is quite unnecessary to enter
here into all the details of his dismissal by Mr.
Lidgett. Such details, with the full names and
dates and references, will be found in the larger
report of these occurrences that was laid before the
Society for the Investigation of Abnormal Phenomena.
The singular transposition of Plattner&rsquo;s
right and left sides was scarcely observed for the
first day or so, and then first in connection with his
disposition to write from right to left across the
blackboard. He concealed rather than ostended
this curious confirmatory circumstance, as he considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
it would unfavourably affect his prospects
in a new situation. The displacement of his heart
was discovered some months after, when he was
having a tooth extracted under anæsthetics. He
then, very unwillingly, allowed a cursory surgical
examination to be made of himself, with a view to
a brief account in the <cite>Journal of Anatomy</cite>. That
exhausts the statement of the material facts; and
we may now go on to consider Plattner&rsquo;s account
of the matter.</p>

<p>But first let us clearly differentiate between the
preceding portion of this story and what is to follow.
All I have told thus far is established by such evidence
as even a criminal lawyer would approve.
Every one of the witnesses is still alive; the reader,
if he have the leisure, may hunt the lads out tomorrow,
or even brave the terrors of the redoubtable
Lidgett, and cross-examine and trap and test to his
heart&rsquo;s content; Gottfried Plattner, himself, and his
twisted heart and his three photographs are producible.
It may be taken as proved that he did
disappear for nine days as the consequence of an
explosion; that he returned almost as violently,
under circumstances in their nature annoying to
Mr. Lidgett, whatever the details of those circumstances
may be; and that he returned inverted, just
as a reflection returns from a mirror. From the
last fact, as I have already stated, it follows almost
inevitably that Plattner, during those nine days,
must have been in some state of existence altogether
out of space. The evidence to these statements is,
indeed, far stronger than that upon which most
murderers are hanged. But for his own particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
account of where he had been, with its confused
explanations and well-nigh self-contradictory details,
we have only Mr. Gottfried Plattner&rsquo;s word. I do
not wish to discredit that, but I must point out&mdash;what
so many writers upon obscure psychic phenomena
fail to do&mdash;that we are passing here from the
practically undeniable to that kind of matter which
any reasonable man is entitled to believe or reject
as he thinks proper. The previous statements
render it plausible; its discordance with common
experience tilts it towards the incredible. I would
prefer not to sway the beam of the reader&rsquo;s judgment
either way, but simply to tell the story as
Plattner told it me.</p>

<p>He gave me his narrative, I may state, at my
house at Chislehurst, and so soon as he had left
me that evening, I went into my study and wrote
down everything as I remembered it. Subsequently
he was good enough to read over a type-written
copy, so that its substantial correctness is undeniable.</p>

<p>He states that at the moment of the explosion he
distinctly thought he was killed. He felt lifted off
his feet and driven forcibly backward. It is a
curious fact for psychologists that he thought clearly
during his backward flight, and wondered whether
he should hit the chemistry cupboard or the blackboard
easel. His heels struck ground, and he
staggered and fell heavily into a sitting position on
something soft and firm. For a moment the concussion
stunned him. He became aware at once of
a vivid scent of singed hair, and he seemed to hear
the voice of Lidgett asking for him. You will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
understand that for a time his mind was greatly
confused.</p>

<p>At first he was distinctly under the impression
that he was still in the classroom. He perceived
quite distinctly the surprise of the boys and the
entry of Mr. Lidgett. He is quite positive upon
that score. He did not hear their remarks; but
that he ascribed to the deafening effect of the experiment.
Things about him seemed curiously dark
and faint, but his mind explained that on the
obvious but mistaken idea that the explosion had
engendered a huge volume of dark smoke. Through
the dimness the figures of Lidgett and the boys
moved, as faint and silent as ghosts. Plattner&rsquo;s
face still tingled with the stinging heat of the flash.
He was, he says, &ldquo;all muddled.&rdquo; His first definite
thoughts seem to have been of his personal safety.
He thought he was perhaps blinded and deafened.
He felt his limbs and face in a gingerly manner.
Then his perceptions grew clearer, and he was
astonished to miss the old familiar desks and other
schoolroom furniture about him. Only dim, uncertain,
grey shapes stood in the place of these.
Then came a thing that made him shout aloud, and
awoke his stunned faculties to instant activity. <em>Two
of the boys, gesticulating, walked one after the other
clean through him!</em> Neither manifested the slightest
consciousness of his presence. It is difficult to
imagine the sensation he felt. They came against
him, he says, with no more force than a wisp of mist.</p>

<p>Plattner&rsquo;s first thought after that was that he was
dead. Having been brought up with thoroughly
sound views in these matters, however, he was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
little surprised to find his body still about him.
His second conclusion was that he was not dead,
but that the others were: that the explosion had
destroyed the Sussexville Proprietary School and
every soul in it except himself. But that, too, was
scarcely satisfactory. He was thrown back upon
astonished observation.</p>

<p>Everything about him was extraordinarily dark:
at first it seemed to have an altogether ebony blackness.
Overhead was a black firmament. The only
touch of light in the scene was a faint greenish glow
at the edge of the sky in one direction, which threw
into prominence a horizon of undulating black hills.
This, I say, was his impression at first. As his eye
grew accustomed to the darkness, he began to distinguish
a faint quality of differentiating greenish
colour in the circumambient night. Against this
background the furniture and occupants of the
classroom, it seems, stood out like phosphorescent
spectres, faint and impalpable. He extended his
hand, and thrust it without an effort through the
wall of the room by the fireplace.</p>

<p>He describes himself as making a strenuous effort
to attract attention. He shouted to Lidgett, and
tried to seize the boys as they went to and fro.
He only desisted from these attempts when Mrs.
Lidgett, whom he (as an Assistant Master) naturally
disliked, entered the room. He says the sensation
of being in the world, and yet not a part of it,
was an extraordinarily disagreeable one. He compared
his feelings, not inaptly, to those of a cat
watching a mouse through a window. Whenever
he made a motion to communicate with the dim,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
familiar world about him, he found an invisible,
incomprehensible barrier preventing intercourse.</p>

<p>He then turned his attention to his solid environment.
He found the medicine bottle still unbroken
in his hand, with the remainder of the green powder
therein. He put this in his pocket, and began to
feel about him. Apparently, he was sitting on a
boulder of rock covered with a velvety moss. The
dark country about him he was unable to see, the
faint, misty picture of the schoolroom blotting it out,
but he had a feeling (due perhaps to a cold wind)
that he was near the crest of a hill, and that a
steep valley fell away beneath his feet. The green
glow along the edge of the sky seemed to be growing
in extent and intensity. He stood up, rubbing
his eyes.</p>

<p>It would seem that he made a few steps, going
steeply down hill, and then stumbled, nearly fell,
and sat down again upon a jagged mass of rock to
watch the dawn. He became aware that the world
about him was absolutely silent. It was as still as
it was dark, and though there was a cold wind blowing
up the hill-face, the rustle of grass, the soughing
of the boughs that should have accompanied it, were
absent. He could hear, therefore, if he could not
see, that the hillside upon which he stood was rocky
and desolate. The green grew brighter every
moment, and as it did so a faint, transparent blood-red
mingled with, but did not mitigate, the blackness
of the sky overhead and the rocky desolations about
him. Having regard to what follows, I am inclined
to think that that redness may have been an optical
effect due to contrast. Something black fluttered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
momentarily against the livid yellow-green of the
lower sky, and then the thin and penetrating voice
of a bell rose out of the black gulf below him. An
oppressive expectation grew with the growing light.</p>

<p>It is probable that an hour or more elapsed while
he sat there, the strange green light growing brighter
every moment, and spreading slowly, in flamboyant
fingers, upward towards the zenith. As it grew, the
spectral vision of <em>our</em> world became relatively or
absolutely fainter. Probably both, for the time
must have been about that of our earthly sunset.
So far as his vision of our world went, Plattner, by
his few steps downhill, had passed through the floor
of the classroom, and was now, it seemed, sitting in
mid-air in the larger schoolroom downstairs. He
saw the boarders distinctly, but much more faintly
than he had seen Lidgett. They were preparing
their evening tasks, and he noticed with interest
that several were cheating with their Euclid riders
by means of a crib, a compilation whose existence
he had hitherto never suspected. As the time
passed, they faded steadily, as steadily as the light
of the green dawn increased.</p>

<p>Looking down into the valley, he saw that the
light had crept far down its rocky sides, and that
the profound blackness of the abyss was now broken
by a minute green glow, like the light of a glow-worm.
And almost immediately the limb of a huge
heavenly body of blazing green rose over the basaltic
undulations of the distant hills, and the monstrous
hill-masses about him came out gaunt and desolate,
in green light and deep, ruddy black shadows. He
became aware of a vast number of ball-shaped objects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
drifting as thistledown drifts over the high ground.
There were none of these nearer to him than the
opposite side of the gorge. The bell below twanged
quicker and quicker, with something like impatient
insistence, and several lights moved hither and
thither. The boys at work at their desks were now
almost imperceptibly faint.</p>

<p>This extinction of our world, when the green sun
of this other universe rose, is a curious point upon
which Plattner insists. During the Other-World
night it is difficult to move about, on account of
the vividness with which the things of this world
are visible. It becomes a riddle to explain why, if
this is the case, we in this world catch no glimpse of
the Other-World. It is due, perhaps, to the comparatively
vivid illumination of this world of ours.
Plattner describes the midday of the Other-World,
at its brightest, as not being nearly so bright as this
world at full moon, while its night is profoundly
black. Consequently, the amount of light, even in an
ordinary dark room, is sufficient to render the things
of the Other-World invisible, on the same principle
that faint phosphorescence is only visible in the profoundest
darkness. I have tried, since he told me
his story, to see something of the Other-World by
sitting for a long space in a photographer&rsquo;s dark
room at night. I have certainly seen indistinctly
the form of greenish slopes and rocks, but only, I
must admit, very indistinctly indeed. The reader
may possibly be more successful. Plattner tells me
that since his return he has dreamt and seen and
recognised places in the Other-World, but this is
probably due to his memory of these scenes. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
seems quite possible that people with unusually keen
eyesight may occasionally catch a glimpse of this
strange Other-World about us.</p>

<p>However, this is a digression. As the green sun
rose, a long street of black buildings became perceptible,
though only darkly and indistinctly, in the
gorge, and, after some hesitation, Plattner began to
clamber down the precipitous descent towards them.
The descent was long and exceedingly tedious, being
so not only by the extraordinary steepness, but also
by reason of the looseness of the boulders with which
the whole face of the hill was strewn. The noise of
his descent&mdash;now and then his heels struck fire from
the rocks&mdash;seemed now the only sound in the universe,
for the beating of the bell had ceased. As he
drew nearer, he perceived that the various edifices
had a singular resemblance to tombs and mausoleums
and monuments, saving only that they were
all uniformly black instead of being white, as most
sepulchres are. And then he saw, crowding out of
the largest building, very much as people disperse
from church, a number of pallid, rounded, pale-green
figures. These dispersed in several directions about
the broad street of the place, some going through
side alleys and reappearing upon the steepness of
the hill, others entering some of the small black
buildings which lined the way.</p>

<p>At the sight of these things drifting up towards
him, Plattner stopped, staring. They were not
walking, they were indeed limbless, and they had
the appearance of human heads, beneath which a
tadpole-like body swung. He was too astonished
at their strangeness, too full, indeed, of strangeness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
to be seriously alarmed by them. They drove
towards him, in front of the chill wind that was
blowing uphill, much as soap-bubbles drive before a
draught. And as he looked at the nearest of those
approaching, he saw it was indeed a human head,
albeit with singularly large eyes, and wearing such
an expression of distress and anguish as he had
never seen before upon mortal countenance. He
was surprised to find that it did not turn to regard
him, but seemed to be watching and following some
unseen moving thing. For a moment he was puzzled,
and then it occurred to him that this creature was
watching with its enormous eyes something that was
happening in the world he had just left. Nearer it
came, and nearer, and he was too astonished to cry
out. It made a very faint fretting sound as it came
close to him. Then it struck his face with a gentle
pat&mdash;its touch was very cold&mdash;and drove past him,
and upward towards the crest of the hill.</p>

<p>An extraordinary conviction flashed across Plattner&rsquo;s
mind that this head had a strong likeness to
Lidgett. Then he turned his attention to the other
heads that were now swarming thickly up the hillside.
None made the slightest sign of recognition.
One or two, indeed, came close to his head and
almost followed the example of the first, but he
dodged convulsively out of the way. Upon most
of them he saw the same expression of unavailing
regret he had seen upon the first, and heard the
same faint sounds of wretchedness from them. One
or two wept, and one rolling swiftly uphill wore an
expression of diabolical rage. But others were cold,
and several had a look of gratified interest in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
eyes. One, at least, was almost in an ecstasy of
happiness. Plattner does not remember that he
recognised any more likenesses in those he saw at
this time.</p>

<p>For several hours, perhaps, Plattner watched these
strange things dispersing themselves over the hills,
and not till long after they had ceased to issue from
the clustering black buildings in the gorge, did he
resume his downward climb. The darkness about
him increased so much that he had a difficulty in
stepping true. Overhead the sky was now a bright,
pale green. He felt neither hunger nor thirst.
Later, when he did, he found a chilly stream running
down the centre of the gorge, and the rare
moss upon the boulders, when he tried it at last in
desperation, was good to eat.</p>

<p>He groped about among the tombs that ran down
the gorge, seeking vaguely for some clue to these
inexplicable things. After a long time he came to
the entrance of the big mausoleum-like building from
which the heads had issued. In this he found a
group of green lights burning upon a kind of basaltic
altar, and a bell-rope from a belfry overhead hanging
down into the centre of the place. Round the wall
ran a lettering of fire in a character unknown to
him. While he was still wondering at the purport
of these things, he heard the receding tramp of
heavy feet echoing far down the street. He ran
out into the darkness again, but he could see nothing.
He had a mind to pull the bell-rope, and finally
decided to follow the footsteps. But, although he
ran far, he never overtook them; and his shouting
was of no avail. The gorge seemed to extend an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
interminable distance. It was as dark as earthly
starlight throughout its length, while the ghastly
green day lay along the upper edge of its precipices.
There were none of the heads, now, below. They
were all, it seemed, busily occupied along the upper
slopes. Looking up, he saw them drifting hither and
thither, some hovering stationary, some flying swiftly
through the air. It reminded him, he said, of &ldquo;big
snowflakes&rdquo;; only these were black and pale green.</p>

<p>In pursuing the firm, undeviating footsteps that
he never overtook, in groping into new regions of
this endless devil&rsquo;s dyke, in clambering up and down
the pitiless heights, in wandering about the summits,
and in watching the drifting faces, Plattner states
that he spent the better part of seven or eight days.
He did not keep count, he says. Though once or
twice he found eyes watching him, he had word with
no living soul. He slept among the rocks on the
hillside. In the gorge things earthly were invisible,
because, from the earthly standpoint, it was far
underground. On the altitudes, so soon as the
earthly day began, the world became visible to
him. He found himself sometimes stumbling over
the dark green rocks, or arresting himself on a
precipitous brink, while all about him the green
branches of the Sussexville lanes were swaying;
or, again, he seemed to be walking through the
Sussexville streets, or watching unseen the private
business of some household. And then it was he
discovered, that to almost every human being in
our world there pertained some of these drifting
heads: that everyone in the world is watched intermittently
by these helpless disembodiments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>What are they&mdash;these Watchers of the Living?
Plattner never learned. But two, that presently
found and followed him, were like his childhood&rsquo;s
memory of his father and mother. Now and then
other faces turned their eyes upon him: eyes like
those of dead people who had swayed him, or
injured him, or helped him in his youth and manhood.
Whenever they looked at him, Plattner was
overcome with a strange sense of responsibility.
To his mother he ventured to speak; but she made
no answer. She looked sadly, steadfastly, and
tenderly&mdash;a little reproachfully, too, it seemed&mdash;into
his eyes.</p>

<p>He simply tells this story: he does not endeavour
to explain. We are left to surmise who these
Watchers of the Living may be, or if they are
indeed the Dead, why they should so closely and
passionately watch a world they have left for ever.
It may be&mdash;indeed to my mind it seems just&mdash;that,
when our life has closed, when evil or good is
no longer a choice for us, we may still have to
witness the working out of the train of consequences
we have laid. If human souls continue after death,
then surely human interests continue after death.
But that is merely my own guess at the meaning
of the things seen. Plattner offers no interpretation,
for none was given him. It is well the
reader should understand this clearly. Day after
day, with his head reeling, he wandered about this
strange-lit world outside the world, weary and,
towards the end, weak and hungry. By day&mdash;by
our earthly day, that is&mdash;the ghostly vision of the
old familiar scenery of Sussexville, all about him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
irked and worried him. He could not see where
to put his feet, and ever and again with a chilly
touch one of these Watching Souls would come
against his face. And after dark the multitude of
these Watchers about him, and their intent distress,
confused his mind beyond describing. A great
longing to return to the earthly life that was so
near and yet so remote consumed him. The unearthliness
of things about him produced a positively
painful mental distress. He was worried beyond
describing by his own particular followers. He
would shout at them to desist from staring at him,
scold at them, hurry away from them. They were
always mute and intent. Run as he might over the
uneven ground, they followed his destinies.</p>

<p>On the ninth day, towards evening, Plattner heard
the invisible footsteps approaching, far away down
the gorge. He was then wandering over the broad
crest of the same hill upon which he had fallen in
his entry into this strange Other-World of his. He
turned to hurry down into the gorge, feeling his
way hastily, and was arrested by the sight of the
thing that was happening in a room in a back street
near the school. Both of the people in the room
he knew by sight. The windows were open, the
blinds up, and the setting sun shone clearly into
it, so that it came out quite brightly at first, a vivid
oblong of room, lying like a magic-lantern picture
upon the black landscape and the livid green dawn.
In addition to the sunlight, a candle had just been
lit in the room.</p>

<p>On the bed lay a lank man, his ghastly white
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>face terrible upon the tumbled pillow. His clenched
hands were raised above his head. A little table
beside the bed carried a few medicine bottles, some
toast and water, and an empty glass. Every now
and then the lank man&rsquo;s lips fell apart, to indicate
a word he could not articulate. But the woman
did not notice that he wanted anything, because she
was busy turning out papers from an old-fashioned
bureau in the opposite corner of the room. At first
the picture was very vivid indeed, but as the green
dawn behind it grew brighter and brighter, so it
became fainter and more and more transparent.</p>

<p>As the echoing footsteps paced nearer and nearer,
those footsteps that sound so loud in that Other-World
and come so silently in this, Plattner perceived
about him a great multitude of dim faces
gathering together out of the darkness and watching
the two people in the room. Never before had he
seen so many of the Watchers of the Living. A
multitude had eyes only for the sufferer in the
room, another multitude, in infinite anguish, watched
the woman as she hunted with greedy eyes for
something she could not find. They crowded about
Plattner, they came across his sight and buffeted his
face, the noise of their unavailing regrets was all
about him. He saw clearly only now and then.
At other times the picture quivered dimly, through
the veil of green reflections upon their movements.
In the room it must have been very still, and
Plattner says the candle flame streamed up into
a perfectly vertical line of smoke, but in his ears
each footfall and its echoes beat like a clap of
thunder. And the faces! Two, more particularly
near the woman&rsquo;s: one a woman&rsquo;s also, white and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
clear-featured, a face which might have once been
cold and hard, but which was now softened by the
touch of a wisdom strange to earth. The other
might have been the woman&rsquo;s father. Both were
evidently absorbed in the contemplation of some act
of hateful meanness, so it seemed, which they could
no longer guard against and prevent. Behind were
others, teachers, it may be, who had taught ill, friends
whose influence had failed. And over the man, too&mdash;a
multitude, but none that seemed to be parents
or teachers! Faces that might once have been
coarse, now purged to strength by sorrow! And
in the forefront one face, a girlish one, neither angry
nor remorseful, but merely patient and weary, and,
as it seemed to Plattner, waiting for relief. His
powers of description fail him at the memory of this
multitude of ghastly countenances. They gathered
on the stroke of the bell. He saw them all in the
space of a second. It would seem that he was so
worked on by his excitement that, quite involuntarily,
his restless fingers took the bottle of green powder
out of his pocket and held it before him. But he
does not remember that.</p>

<p>Abruptly the footsteps ceased. He waited for
the next, and there was silence, and then suddenly,
cutting through the unexpected stillness like a keen,
thin blade, came the first stroke of the bell. At
that the multitudinous faces swayed to and fro, and
a louder crying began all about him. The woman
did not hear; she was burning something now in
the candle flame. At the second stroke everything
grew dim, and a breath of wind, icy cold, blew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>through the host of watchers. They swirled about
him like an eddy of dead leaves in the spring, and at the
third stroke something was extended through them to
the bed. You have heard of a beam of light. This
was like a beam of darkness, and looking again at it,
Plattner saw that it was a shadowy arm and hand.</p>

<p>The green sun was now topping the black desolations
of the horizon, and the vision of the room was
very faint. Plattner could see that the white of the
bed struggled, and was convulsed; and that the woman
looked round over her shoulder at it, startled.</p>

<p>The cloud of watchers lifted high like a puff of
green dust before the wind, and swept swiftly downward
towards the temple in the gorge. Then
suddenly Plattner understood the meaning of the
shadowy black arm that stretched across his shoulder
and clutched its prey. He did not dare turn his head to
see the Shadow behind the arm. With a violent effort,
and covering his eyes, he set himself to run, made, perhaps,
twenty strides, then slipped on a boulder, and
fell. He fell forward on his hands; and the bottle
smashed and exploded as he touched the ground.</p>

<p>In another moment he found himself, stunned and
bleeding, sitting face to face with Lidgett in the old
walled garden behind the school.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>There the story of Plattner&rsquo;s experiences ends.
I have resisted, I believe successfully, the natural
disposition of a writer of fiction to dress up incidents
of this sort. I have told the thing as far as possible
in the order in which Plattner told it to me. I have
carefully avoided any attempt at style, effect, or
construction. It would have been easy, for instance,
to have worked the scene of the death-bed into a kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
of plot in which Plattner might have been involved.
But, quite apart from the objectionableness of falsifying
a most extraordinary true story, any such trite
devices would spoil, to my mind, the peculiar effect
of this dark world, with its livid green illumination
and its drifting Watchers of the Living, which, unseen
and unapproachable to us, is yet lying all about us.</p>

<p>It remains to add, that a death did actually occur
in Vincent Terrace, just beyond the school garden,
and, so far as can be proved, at the moment of
Plattner&rsquo;s return. Deceased was a rate-collector
and insurance agent. His widow, who was much
younger than himself, married last month a Mr.
Whymper, a veterinary surgeon of Allbeeding. As
the portion of this story given here has in various
forms circulated orally in Sussexville, she has consented
to my use of her name, on condition that I
make it distinctly known that she emphatically contradicts
every detail of Plattner&rsquo;s account of her
husband&rsquo;s last moments. She burnt no will, she
says, although Plattner never accused her of doing
so: her husband made but one will, and that just
after their marriage. Certainly, from a man who
had never seen it, Plattner&rsquo;s account of the furniture
of the room was curiously accurate.</p>

<p>One other thing, even at the risk of an irksome
repetition, I must insist upon, lest I seem to favour
the credulous superstitious view. Plattner&rsquo;s absence
from the world for nine days is, I think, proved.
But that does not prove his story. It is quite conceivable
that even outside space hallucinations may
be possible. That, at least, the reader must bear

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">One</span> saw Monson&rsquo;s Flying Machine from the
windows of the trains passing either along
the South-Western main line or along the
line between Wimbledon and Worcester Park,&mdash;to
be more exact, one saw the huge scaffoldings which
limited the flight of the apparatus. They rose over
the tree-tops, a massive alley of interlacing iron and
timber, and an enormous web of ropes and tackle,
extending the best part of two miles. From the
Leatherhead branch this alley was foreshortened
and in part hidden by a hill with villas; but from
the main line one had it in profile, a complex tangle
of girders and curving bars, very impressive to the
excursionists from Portsmouth and Southampton
and the West. Monson had taken up the work
where Maxim had left it, had gone on at first with
an utter contempt for the journalistic wit and
ignorance that had irritated and hampered his predecessor,
and had spent (it was said) rather more
than half his immense fortune upon his experiments.
The results, to an impatient generation, seemed inconsiderable.
When some five years had passed
after the growth of the colossal iron groves at
Worcester Park, and Monson still failed to put in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
a fluttering appearance over Trafalgar Square, even
the Isle of Wight trippers felt their liberty to smile.
And such intelligent people as did not consider
Monson a fool stricken with the mania for invention,
denounced him as being (for no particular reason)
a self-advertising quack.</p>

<p>Yet now and again a morning trainload of season-ticket
holders would see a white monster rush headlong
through the airy tracery of guides and bars,
and hear the further stays, nettings, and buffers
snap, creak, and groan with the impact of the blow.
Then there would be an efflorescence of black-set
white-rimmed faces along the sides of the train, and
the morning papers would be neglected for a vigorous
discussion of the possibility of flying (in which
nothing new was ever said by any chance), until
the train reached Waterloo, and its cargo of season-ticket
holders dispersed themselves over London.
Or the fathers and mothers in some multitudinous
train of weary excursionists returning exhausted
from a day of rest by the sea, would find the dark
fabric, standing out against the evening sky, useful
in diverting some bilious child from its introspection,
and be suddenly startled by the swift transit of a
huge black flapping shape that strained upward
against the guides. It was a great and forcible
thing beyond dispute, and excellent for conversation;
yet, all the same, it was but flying in leading-strings,
and most of those who witnessed it scarcely
counted its flight as flying. More of a switchback
it seemed to the run of the folk.</p>

<p>Monson, I say, did not trouble himself very keenly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>about the opinions of the press at first. But possibly
he, even, had formed but a poor idea of the
time it would take before the tactics of flying were
mastered, the swift assured adjustment of the big
soaring shape to every gust and chance movement
of the air; nor had he clearly reckoned the money
this prolonged struggle against gravitation would
cost him. And he was not so pachydermatous as
he seemed. Secretly he had his periodical bundles
of cuttings sent him by Romeike, he had his periodical
reminders from his banker; and if he did not mind
the initial ridicule and scepticism, he felt the growing
neglect as the months went by and the money
dribbled away. Time was when Monson had sent
the enterprising journalist, keen after readable
matter, empty from his gates. But when the enterprising
journalist ceased from troubling, Monson
was anything but satisfied in his heart of hearts.
Still day by day the work went on, and the multitudinous
subtle difficulties of the steering diminished
in number. Day by day, too, the money trickled
away, until his balance was no longer a matter of
hundreds of thousands, but of tens. And at last
came an anniversary.</p>

<p>Monson, sitting in the little drawing-shed, suddenly
noticed the date on Woodhouse&rsquo;s calendar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was five years ago to-day that we began,&rdquo; he
said to Woodhouse suddenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; said Woodhouse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the alterations play the devil with us,&rdquo; said
Monson, biting a paper-fastener.</p>

<p>The drawings for the new vans to the hinder
screw lay on the table before him as he spoke. He
pitched the mutilated brass paper-fastener into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
waste-paper basket and drummed with his fingers.
&ldquo;These alterations! Will the mathematicians ever
be clever enough to save us all this patching and
experimenting? Five years&mdash;learning by rule of
thumb, when one might think that it was possible
to calculate the whole thing out beforehand. The
cost of it! I might have hired three senior wranglers
for life. But they&rsquo;d only have developed some
beautifully useless theorems in pneumatics. What
a time it has been, Woodhouse!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;These mouldings will take three weeks,&rdquo; said
Woodhouse. &ldquo;At special prices.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three weeks!&rdquo; said Monson, and sat drumming.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three weeks certain,&rdquo; said Woodhouse, an
excellent engineer, but no good as a comforter.
He drew the sheets towards him and began shading
a bar.</p>

<p>Monson stopped drumming, and began to bite
his finger-nails, staring the while at Woodhouse&rsquo;s
head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long have they been calling this Monson&rsquo;s
Folly?&rdquo; he said suddenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Oh!</em> Year or so,&rdquo; said Woodhouse carelessly,
without looking up.</p>

<p>Monson sucked the air in between his teeth, and
went to the window. The stout iron columns
carrying the elevated rails upon which the start of
the machine was made rose up close by, and the
machine was hidden by the upper edge of the window.
Through the grove of iron pillars, red painted
and ornate with rows of bolts, one had a glimpse of
the pretty scenery towards Esher. A train went gliding
noiselessly across the middle distance, its rattle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
drowned by the hammering of the workmen overhead.
Monson could imagine the grinning faces at
the windows of the carriages. He swore savagely
under his breath, and dabbed viciously at a blowfly
that suddenly became noisy on the window-pane.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; said Woodhouse, staring in surprise
at his employer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m about sick of this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Woodhouse scratched his cheek. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he said,
after an assimilating pause. He pushed the drawing
away from him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here these fools ... I&rsquo;m trying to conquer a new
element&mdash;trying to do a thing that will revolutionise
life. And instead of taking an intelligent interest,
they grin and make their stupid jokes, and call me
and my appliances names.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Asses!&rdquo; said Woodhouse, letting his eye fall
again on the drawing.</p>

<p>The epithet, curiously enough, made Monson
wince. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m about sick of it, Woodhouse, anyhow,&rdquo;
he said, after a pause.</p>

<p>Woodhouse shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing for it but patience, I suppose,&rdquo;
said Monson, sticking his hands in his pockets.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve started. I&rsquo;ve made my bed, and I&rsquo;ve got to
lie on it. I can&rsquo;t go back. I&rsquo;ll see it through, and
spend every penny I have and every penny I can
borrow. But I tell you, Woodhouse, I&rsquo;m infernally
sick of it, all the same. If I&rsquo;d paid a tenth part of
the money towards some political greaser&rsquo;s expenses&mdash;I&rsquo;d
have been a baronet before this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Monson paused. Woodhouse stared in front of
him with a blank expression he always employed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
to indicate sympathy, and tapped his pencil-case
on the table. Monson stared at him for a minute.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, <em>damn</em>!&rdquo; said Monson suddenly, and abruptly
rushed out of the room.</p>

<p>Woodhouse continued his sympathetic rigour for
perhaps half a minute. Then he sighed and resumed
the shading of the drawings. Something had evidently
upset Monson. Nice chap, and generous,
but difficult to get on with. It was the way with
every amateur who had anything to do with engineering&mdash;wanted
everything finished at once. But
Monson had usually the patience of the expert.
Odd he was so irritable. Nice and round that
aluminium rod did look now! Woodhouse threw
back his head, and put it, first this side and then
that, to appreciate his bit of shading better.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Woodhouse,&rdquo; said Hooper, the foreman of
the labourers, putting his head in at the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; said Woodhouse, without turning
round.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing happened, sir?&rdquo; said Hooper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Happened?&rdquo; said Woodhouse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The governor just been up the rails swearing
like a tornader.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Oh!</em>&rdquo; said Woodhouse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t like him, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I was thinking perhaps&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think,&rdquo; said Woodhouse, still admiring
the drawings.</p>

<p>Hooper knew Woodhouse, and he shut the door
suddenly with a vicious slam. Woodhouse stared
stonily before him for some further minutes, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
then made an ineffectual effort to pick his teeth
with his pencil. Abruptly he desisted, pitched that
old, tried, and stumpy servitor across the room, got
up, stretched himself, and followed Hooper.</p>

<p>He looked ruffled&mdash;it was visible to every workman
he met. When a millionaire who has been
spending thousands on experiments that employ
quite a little army of people suddenly indicates that
he is sick of the undertaking, there is almost invariably
a certain amount of mental friction in the
ranks of the little army he employs. And even
before he indicates his intentions there are speculations
and murmurs, a watching of faces and a study
of straws. Hundreds of people knew before the day
was out that Monson was ruffled, Woodhouse ruffled,
Hooper ruffled. A workman&rsquo;s wife, for instance
(whom Monson had never seen), decided to keep her
money in the savings-bank instead of buying a
velveteen dress. So far-reaching are even the casual
curses of a millionaire.</p>

<p>Monson found a certain satisfaction in going on
the works and behaving disagreeably to as many
people as possible. After a time even that palled
upon him, and he rode off the grounds, to every
one&rsquo;s relief there, and through the lanes south-eastward,
to the infinite tribulation of his house steward
at Cheam.</p>

<p>And the immediate cause of it all, the little grain
of annoyance that had suddenly precipitated all this
discontent with his life-work was&mdash;these trivial
things that direct all our great decisions!&mdash;half a
dozen ill-considered remarks made by a pretty girl,
prettily dressed, with a beautiful voice and something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
more than prettiness in her soft grey eyes. And of
these half-dozen remarks, two words especially&mdash;&ldquo;Monson&rsquo;s
Folly.&rdquo; She had felt she was behaving
charmingly to Monson; she reflected the next day
how exceptionally effective she had been, and no
one would have been more amazed than she, had
she learned the effect she had left on Monson&rsquo;s mind.
I hope, considering everything, that she never knew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How are you getting on with your flying-machine?&rdquo;
she asked. (&ldquo;I wonder if I shall ever
meet any one with the sense not to ask that,&rdquo;
thought Monson.) &ldquo;It will be very dangerous at
first, will it not?&rdquo; (&ldquo;Thinks I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;) &ldquo;Jorgon
is going to play presently; have you heard him
before?&rdquo; (&ldquo;My mania being attended to, we turn
to rational conversation.&rdquo;) Gush about Jorgon;
gradual decline of conversation, ending with&mdash;&ldquo;You
must let me know when your flying-machine is
finished, Mr. Monson, and then I will consider the
advisability of taking a ticket.&rdquo; (&ldquo;One would think
I was still playing inventions in the nursery.&rdquo;) But
the bitterest thing she said was not meant for
Monson&rsquo;s ears. To Phlox, the novelist, she was
always conscientiously brilliant. &ldquo;I have been talking
to Mr. Monson, and he can think of nothing,
positively nothing, but that flying-machine of his.
Do you know, all his workmen call that place of
his &lsquo;Monson&rsquo;s Folly&rsquo;? He is quite impossible. It
is really very, very sad. I always regard him
myself in the light of sunken treasure&mdash;the Lost
Millionaire, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was pretty and well educated,&mdash;indeed, she
had written an epigrammatic novelette; but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
bitterness was that she was typical. She summarised
what the world thought of the man who was working
sanely, steadily, and surely towards a more tremendous
revolution in the appliances of civilisation,
a more far-reaching alteration in the ways of
humanity than has ever been effected since history
began. They did not even take him seriously. In
a little while he would be proverbial. &ldquo;I <em>must</em> fly
now,&rdquo; he said on his way home, smarting with a
sense of absolute social failure. &ldquo;I must fly soon.
If it doesn&rsquo;t come off soon, by God! I shall run
amuck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He said that before he had gone through his
pass-book and his litter of papers. Inadequate as
the cause seems, it was that girl&rsquo;s voice and the
expression of her eyes that precipitated his discontent.
But certainly the discovery that he had
no longer even one hundred thousand pounds&rsquo; worth
of realisable property behind him was the poison
that made the wound deadly.</p>

<p>It was the next day after this that he exploded
upon Woodhouse and his workmen, and thereafter
his bearing was consistently grim for three weeks,
and anxiety dwelt in Cheam and Ewell, Malden,
Morden, and Worcester Park, places that had thriven
mightily on his experiments.</p>

<p>Four weeks after that first swearing of his, he
stood with Woodhouse by the reconstructed machine
as it lay across the elevated railway, by means of
which it gained its initial impetus. The new propeller
glittered a brighter white than the rest of the
machine, and a gilder, obedient to a whim of
Monson&rsquo;s, was picking out the aluminium bars with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
gold. And looking down the long avenue between
the ropes (gilded now with the sunset), one saw red
signals, and two miles away an ant-hill of workmen
busy altering the last falls of the run into a rising
slope.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll <em>come</em>,&rdquo; said Woodhouse. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come right
enough. But I tell you it&rsquo;s infernally foolhardy.
If only you would give another year&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you I won&rsquo;t. I tell you the thing works.
I&rsquo;ve given years enough&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that,&rdquo; said Woodhouse. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all
right with the machine. But it&rsquo;s the steering&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I been rushing, night and morning,
backwards and forwards, through this squirrel&rsquo;s cage?
If the thing steers true here, it will steer true all
across England. It&rsquo;s just funk, I tell you, Woodhouse.
We could have gone a year ago. And
besides&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Woodhouse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The money!&rdquo; snapped Monson over his shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hang it! I never thought of the money,&rdquo; said
Woodhouse, and then, speaking now in a very
different tone to that with which he had said the
words before, he repeated, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come. Trust me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Monson turned suddenly, and saw all that Woodhouse
had not the dexterity to say, shining on his
sunset-lit face. He looked for a moment, then impulsively
extended his hand. &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Woodhouse, gripping the hand,
and with a queer softening of his features. &ldquo;Trust
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then both men turned to the big apparatus that
lay with its flat wings extended upon the carrier,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
and stared at it meditatively. Monson, guided
perhaps by a photographic study of the flight of
birds, and by Lilienthal&rsquo;s methods, had gradually
drifted from Maxim&rsquo;s shapes towards the bird form
again. The thing, however, was driven by a huge
screw behind in the place of the tail; and so hovering,
which needs an almost vertical adjustment of a
flat tail, was rendered impossible. The body of the
machine was small, almost cylindrical, and pointed.
Forward and aft on the pointed ends were two small
petroleum engines for the screw, and the navigators
sat deep in a canoe-like recess, the foremost one
steering, and being protected by a low screen, with
two plate-glass windows, from the blinding rush of air.
On either side a monstrous flat framework with a
curved front border could be adjusted so as either
to lie horizontally, or to be tilted upward or down.
These wings worked rigidly together, or, by releasing
a pin, one could be tilted through a small angle
independently of its fellow. The front edge of
either wing could also be shifted back so as to
diminish the wing-area about one-sixth. The
machine was not only not designed to hover, but
it was also incapable of fluttering. Monson&rsquo;s idea
was to get into the air with the initial rush of the
apparatus, and then to skim, much as a playing-card
may be skimmed, keeping up the rush by means of
the screw at the stern. Rooks and gulls fly enormous
distances in that way with scarcely a perceptible
movement of the wings. The bird really drives
along on an aërial switchback. It glides slanting
downward for a space, until it has gained considerable
momentum, and then altering the inclination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
of its wings, glides up again almost to its original
altitude. Even a Londoner who has watched the
birds in the aviary in Regent&rsquo;s Park knows that.</p>

<p>But the bird is practising this art from the moment
it leaves its nest. It has not only the perfect apparatus,
but the perfect instinct to use it. A man
off his feet has the poorest skill in balancing. Even
the simple trick of the bicycle costs him some hours
of labour. The instantaneous adjustments of the
wings, the quick response to a passing breeze, the swift
recovery of equilibrium, the giddy, eddying movements
that require such absolute precision&mdash;all that
he must learn, learn with infinite labour and infinite
danger, if ever he is to conquer flying. The flying-machine
that will start off some fine day, driven by
neat &ldquo;little levers,&rdquo; with a nice open deck like a
liner, and all loaded up with bombshells and guns,
is the easy dreaming of a literary man. In lives
and in treasure the cost of the conquest of the
empire of the air may even exceed all that has been
spent in man&rsquo;s great conquest of the sea. Certainly
it will be costlier than the greatest war that has ever
devastated the world.</p>

<p>No one knew these things better than these two
practical men. And they knew they were in the
front rank of the coming army. Yet there is hope
even in a forlorn hope. Men are killed outright in
the reserves sometimes, while others who have been
left for dead in the thickest corner crawl out and
survive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we miss these meadows&rdquo;&mdash;said Woodhouse
presently in his slow way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear chap,&rdquo; said Monson, whose spirits had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
been rising fitfully during the last few days, &ldquo;we
mustn&rsquo;t miss these meadows. There&rsquo;s a quarter of
a square mile for us to hit, fences removed, ditches
levelled. We shall come down all right&mdash;rest
assured. And if we don&rsquo;t&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Woodhouse. &ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before the day of the start, the newspaper people
got wind of the alterations at the northward end of
the framework, and Monson was cheered by a decided
change in the comments Romeike forwarded him.
&ldquo;He will be off some day,&rdquo; said the papers. &ldquo;He
will be off some day,&rdquo; said the South-Western
season-ticket holders one to another; the seaside
excursionists, the Saturday-to-Monday trippers from
Sussex and Hampshire and Dorset and Devon, the
eminent literary people from Hazlemere, all remarked
eagerly one to another, &ldquo;He will be off some day,&rdquo;
as the familiar scaffolding came in sight. And
actually, one bright morning, in full view of the
ten-past-ten train from Basingstoke, Monson&rsquo;s flying-machine
started on its journey.</p>

<p>They saw the carrier running swiftly along its
rail, and the white and gold screw spinning in the
air. They heard the rapid rumble of wheels, and a
thud as the carrier reached the buffers at the end
of its run. Then a whirr as the Flying-Machine
was shot forward into the networks. All that the
majority of them had seen and heard before. The
thing went with a drooping flight through the framework
and rose again, and then every beholder
shouted, or screamed, or yelled, or shrieked after his
kind. For instead of the customary concussion and
stoppage, the Flying Machine flew out of its five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
years&rsquo; cage like a bolt from a crossbow, and drove
slantingly upward into the air, curved round a little,
so as to cross the line, and soared in the direction
of Wimbledon Common.</p>

<p>It seemed to hang momentarily in the air and
grow smaller, then it ducked and vanished over the
clustering blue tree-tops to the east of Coombe Hill,
and no one stopped staring and gasping until long
after it had disappeared.</p>

<p>That was what the people in the train from
Basingstoke saw. If you had drawn a line down
the middle of that train, from engine to guard&rsquo;s van,
you would not have found a living soul on the
opposite side to the flying-machine. It was a mad
rush from window to window as the thing crossed
the line. And the engine-driver and stoker never
took their eyes off the low hills about Wimbledon,
and never noticed that they had run clean through
Coombe and Maiden and Raynes Park, until, with
returning animation, they found themselves pelting,
at the most indecent pace, into Wimbledon
station.</p>

<p>From the moment when Monson had started the
carrier with a &ldquo;<em>Now!</em>&rdquo; neither he nor Woodhouse
said a word. Both men sat with clenched teeth.
Monson had crossed the line with a curve that was
too sharp, and Woodhouse had opened and shut his
white lips; but neither spoke. Woodhouse simply
gripped his seat, and breathed sharply through his
teeth, watching the blue country to the west rushing
past, and down, and away from him. Monson
knelt at his post forward, and his hands trembled
on the spoked wheel that moved the wings. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
could see nothing before him but a mass of white
clouds in the sky.</p>

<p>The machine went slanting upward, travelling
with an enormous speed still, but losing momentum
every moment. The land ran away underneath
with diminishing speed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Now!</em>&rdquo; said Woodhouse at last, and with a
violent effort Monson wrenched over the wheel and
altered the angle of the wings. The machine seemed
to hang for half a minute motionless in mid-air, and
then he saw the hazy blue house-covered hills of
Kilburn and Hampstead jump up before his eyes
and rise steadily, until the little sunlit dome of the
Albert Hall appeared through his windows. For a
moment he scarcely understood the meaning of this
upward rush of the horizon, but as the nearer and
nearer houses came into view, he realised what he
had done. He had turned the wings over too far,
and they were swooping steeply downward towards
the Thames.</p>

<p>The thought, the question, the realisation were all
the business of a second of time. &ldquo;Too much!&rdquo;
gasped Woodhouse. Monson brought the wheel
half-way back with a jerk, and forthwith the Kilburn
and Hampstead ridge dropped again to the lower
edge of his windows. They had been a thousand
feet above Coombe and Maiden station; fifty seconds
after they whizzed, at a frightful pace, not eighty
feet above the East Putney station, on the Metropolitan
District line, to the screaming astonishment
of a platformful of people. Monson flung up the
vans against the air, and over Fulham they rushed
up their atmospheric switchback again, steeply&mdash;too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
steeply. The &rsquo;buses went floundering across the
Fulham Road, the people yelled.</p>

<p>Then down again, too steeply still, and the distant
trees and houses about Primrose Hill leapt up across
Monson&rsquo;s window, and then suddenly he saw straight
before him the greenery of Kensington Gardens and
the towers of the Imperial Institute. They were
driving straight down upon South Kensington. The
pinnacles of the Natural History Museum rushed up
into view. There came one fatal second of swift
thought, a moment of hesitation. Should he try
and clear the towers, or swerve eastward?</p>

<p>He made a hesitating attempt to release the right
wing, left the catch half released, and gave a frantic
clutch at the wheel.</p>

<p>The nose of the machine seemed to leap up before
him. The wheel pressed his hand with irresistible
force, and jerked itself out of his control.</p>

<p>Woodhouse, sitting crouched together, gave a
hoarse cry, and sprang up towards Monson. &ldquo;Too
far!&rdquo; he cried, and then he was clinging to the
gunwale for dear life, and Monson had been jerked
clean overhead, and was falling backwards upon
him.</p>

<p>So swiftly had the thing happened that barely a
quarter of the people going to and fro in Hyde Park,
and Brompton Road, and the Exhibition Road saw
anything of the aërial catastrophe. A distant winged
shape had appeared above the clustering houses to the
south, had fallen and risen, growing larger as it did
so; had swooped swiftly down towards the Imperial
Institute, a broad spread of flying wings, had swept
round in a quarter circle, dashed eastward, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
suddenly sprang vertically into the air. A black
object shot out of it, and came spinning downward.
A man! Two men clutching each other! They
came whirling down, separated as they struck the
roof of the Students&rsquo; Club, and bounded off into the
green bushes on its southward side.</p>

<p>For perhaps half a minute, the pointed stem of
the big machine still pierced vertically upward, the
screw spinning desperately. For one brief instant,
that yet seemed an age to all who watched, it had
hung motionless in mid-air. Then a spout of yellow
flame licked up its length from the stern engine, and
swift, swifter, swifter, and flaring like a rocket, it
rushed down upon the solid mass of masonry which
was formerly the Royal College of Science. The
big screw of white and gold touched the parapet,
and crumpled up like wet linen. Then the blazing
spindle-shaped body smashed and splintered, smashing
and splintering in its fall, upon the north-westward
angle of the building.</p>

<p>But the crash, the flame of blazing paraffin that
shot heavenward from the shattered engines of the
machine, the crushed horrors that were found in the
garden beyond the Students&rsquo; Club, the masses of
yellow parapet and red brick that fell headlong into the
roadway, the running to and fro of people like ants
in a broken ant-hill, the galloping of fire-engines, the
gathering of crowds&mdash;all these things do not belong
to this story, which was written only to tell how the
first of all successful flying-machines was launched
and flew. Though he failed, and failed disastrously,
the record of Monson&rsquo;s work remains&mdash;a sufficient
monument&mdash;to guide the next of that band of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
gallant experimentalists who will sooner or later
master this great problem of flying. And between
Worcester Park and Malden there still stands that
portentous avenue of iron-work, rusting now, and
dangerous here and there, to witness to the first
desperate struggle for man&rsquo;s right of way through
the air.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_STORY_OF_THE_LATE_MR_ELVESHAM" id="THE_STORY_OF_THE_LATE_MR_ELVESHAM">THE STORY OF THE LATE MR.
ELVESHAM</a></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">I set</span> this story down, not expecting it will be
believed, but, if possible, to prepare a way of
escape for the next victim. He, perhaps, may
profit by my misfortune. My own case, I know, is
hopeless, and I am now in some measure prepared
to meet my fate.</p>

<p>My name is Edward George Eden. I was born
at Trentham, in Staffordshire, my father being
employed in the gardens there. I lost my mother
when I was three years old, and my father when I
was five, my uncle, George Eden, then adopting me
as his own son. He was a single man, self-educated,
and well-known in Birmingham as an enterprising
journalist; he educated me generously, fired my
ambition to succeed in the world, and at his death,
which happened four years ago, left me his entire
fortune, a matter of about five hundred pounds after
all outgoing charges were paid. I was then eighteen.
He advised me in his will to expend the money in
completing my education. I had already chosen
the profession of medicine, and through his posthumous
generosity, and my good fortune in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
scholarship competition, I became a medical student
at University College, London. At the time of the
beginning of my story I lodged at 11<span class="f8">A</span> University
Street, in a little upper room, very shabbily furnished,
and draughty, overlooking the back of
Shoolbred&rsquo;s premises. I used this little room both
to live in and sleep in, because I was anxious to
eke out my means to the very last shillingsworth.</p>

<p>I was taking a pair of shoes to be mended at a
shop in the Tottenham Court Road when I first
encountered the little old man with the yellow face,
with whom my life has now become so inextricably
entangled. He was standing on the kerb, and staring
at the number on the door in a doubtful way, as
I opened it. His eyes&mdash;they were dull grey eyes,
and reddish under the rims&mdash;fell to my face, and
his countenance immediately assumed an expression
of corrugated amiability.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You come,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;apt to the moment. I
had forgotten the number of your house. How do
you do, Mr. Eden?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was a little astonished at his familiar address,
for I had never set eyes on the man before. I was
a little annoyed, too, at his catching me with my
boots under my arm. He noticed my lack of
cordiality.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wonder who the deuce I am, eh? A friend,
let me assure you. I have seen you before, though
you haven&rsquo;t seen me. Is there anywhere where I
can talk to you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I hesitated. The shabbiness of my room upstairs
was not a matter for every stranger. &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;we might walk down the street. I&rsquo;m<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
unfortunately prevented&rdquo;&mdash;My gesture explained
the sentence before I had spoken it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The very thing,&rdquo; he said, and faced this way
and then that. &ldquo;The street? Which way shall we
go?&rdquo; I slipped my boots down in the passage.
&ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; he said abruptly; &ldquo;this business of
mine is a rigmarole. Come and lunch with me,
Mr. Eden. I&rsquo;m an old man, a very old man, and
not good at explanations, and what with my piping
voice and the clatter of the traffic&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>He laid a persuasive skinny hand that trembled
a little upon my arm.</p>

<p>I was not so old that an old man might not treat
me to a lunch. Yet at the same time I was not
altogether pleased by this abrupt invitation. &ldquo;I
had rather&rdquo;&mdash;I began. &ldquo;But <em>I</em> had rather,&rdquo; he said,
catching me up, &ldquo;and a certain civility is surely due
to my grey hairs.&rdquo; And so I consented, and went
with him.</p>

<p>He took me to Blavitski&rsquo;s; I had to walk slowly
to accommodate myself to his paces; and over such
a lunch as I had never tasted before, he fended off
my leading questions, and I took a better note of
his appearance. His clean-shaven face was lean
and wrinkled, his shrivelled lips fell over a set of
false teeth, and his white hair was thin and rather
long; he seemed small to me,&mdash;though, indeed, most
people seemed small to me,&mdash;and his shoulders were
rounded and bent. And watching him, I could not
help but observe that he too was taking note of
me, running his eyes, with a curious touch of greed
in them, over me, from my broad shoulders to my
sun-tanned hands, and up to my freckled face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
again. &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said he, as we lit our cigarettes,
&ldquo;I must tell you of the business in hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must tell you, then, that I am an old man, a
very old man.&rdquo; He paused momentarily. &ldquo;And
it happens that I have money that I must presently
be leaving, and never a child have I to leave it to.&rdquo;
I thought of the confidence trick, and resolved I
would be on the alert for the vestiges of my five
hundred pounds. He proceeded to enlarge on his
loneliness, and the trouble he had to find a proper
disposition of his money. &ldquo;I have weighed this
plan and that plan, charities, institutions, and scholarships,
and libraries, and I have come to this conclusion
at last,&rdquo;&mdash;he fixed his eyes on my face,&mdash;&ldquo;that
I will find some young fellow, ambitious, pure-minded,
and poor, healthy in body and healthy in
mind, and, in short, make him my heir, give him all
that I have.&rdquo; He repeated, &ldquo;Give him all that I
have. So that he will suddenly be lifted out of all
the trouble and struggle in which his sympathies
have been educated, to freedom and influence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I tried to seem disinterested. With a transparent
hypocrisy, I said, &ldquo;And you want my help, my professional
services, maybe, to find that person.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He smiled, and looked at me over his cigarette,
and I laughed at his quiet exposure of my modest
pretence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a career such a man might have!&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;It fills me with envy to think how I have
accumulated that another man may spend&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there are conditions, of course, burdens to
be imposed. He must, for instance, take my name.
You cannot expect everything without some return.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
And I must go into all the circumstances of his life
before I can accept him. He <em>must</em> be sound. I
must know his heredity, how his parents and grandparents
died, have the strictest inquiries made into
his private morals&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>This modified my secret congratulations a little.
&ldquo;And do I understand,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that I&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, almost fiercely. &ldquo;You. <em>You.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>I answered never a word. My imagination was
dancing wildly, my innate scepticism was useless to
modify its transports. There was not a particle of
gratitude in my mind&mdash;I did not know what to say
nor how to say it. &ldquo;But why me in particular?&rdquo;
I said at last.</p>

<p>He had chanced to hear of me from Professor
Haslar, he said, as a typically sound and sane young
man, and he wished, as far as possible, to leave his
money where health and integrity were assured.</p>

<p>That was my first meeting with the little old
man. He was mysterious about himself; he would
not give his name yet, he said, and after I had
answered some questions of his, he left me at the
Blavitski portal. I noticed that he drew a handful
of gold coins from his pocket when it came to paying
for the lunch. His insistence upon bodily health
was curious. In accordance with an arrangement
we had made I applied that day for a life policy
in the Loyal Insurance Company for a large sum,
and I was exhaustively overhauled by the medical
advisers of that company in the subsequent week.
Even that did not satisfy him, and he insisted I
must be re-examined by the great Doctor Henderson.
It was Friday in Whitsun week before he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
came to a decision. He called me down, quite
late in the evening,&mdash;nearly nine it was,&mdash;from
cramming chemical equations for my Preliminary
Scientific examination. He was standing in the
passage under the feeble gas-lamp, and his face
was a grotesque interplay of shadows. He seemed
more bowed than when I had first seen him, and
his cheeks had sunk in a little.</p>

<p>His voice shook with emotion. &ldquo;Everything is
satisfactory, Mr. Eden,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Everything is
quite, quite satisfactory. And this night of all
nights, you must dine with me and celebrate your&mdash;accession.&rdquo;
He was interrupted by a cough.
&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t have long to wait, either,&rdquo; he said,
wiping his handkerchief across his lips, and gripping
my hand with his long bony claw that was
disengaged. &ldquo;Certainly not very long to wait.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We went into the street and called a cab. I
remember every incident of that drive vividly, the
swift, easy motion, the vivid contrast of gas and oil
and electric light, the crowds of people in the streets,
the place in Regent Street to which we went, and
the sumptuous dinner we were served with there. I
was disconcerted at first by the well-dressed waiter&rsquo;s
glances at my rough clothes, bothered by the stones
of the olives, but as the champagne warmed my
blood, my confidence revived. At first the old man
talked of himself. He had already told me his
name in the cab; he was Egbert Elvesham, the
great philosopher, whose name I had known since
I was a lad at school. It seemed incredible to me
that this man, whose intelligence had so early dominated
mine, this great abstraction, should suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
realise itself as this decrepit, familiar figure. I daresay
every young fellow who has suddenly fallen
among celebrities has felt something of my disappointment.
He told me now of the future that
the feeble streams of his life would presently leave
dry for me, houses, copyrights, investments; I had
never suspected that philosophers were so rich. He
watched me drink and eat with a touch of envy.
&ldquo;What a capacity for living you have!&rdquo; he said;
and then, with a sigh, a sigh of relief I could have
thought it, &ldquo;It will not be long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said I, my head swimming now with
champagne; &ldquo;I have a future perhaps&mdash;of a passing
agreeable sort, thanks to you. I shall now have
the honour of your name. But you have a past.
Such a past as is worth all my future.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He shook his head and smiled, as I thought,
with half-sad appreciation of my flattering admiration.
&ldquo;That future,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;would you in truth
change it?&rdquo; The waiter came with liqueurs. &ldquo;You
will not perhaps mind taking my name, taking my
position, but would you indeed&mdash;willingly&mdash;take
my years?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With your achievements,&rdquo; said I gallantly.</p>

<p>He smiled again. &ldquo;Kummel&mdash;both,&rdquo; he said to
the waiter, and turned his attention to a little paper
packet he had taken from his pocket. &ldquo;This hour,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;this after-dinner hour is the hour of small
things. Here is a scrap of my unpublished wisdom.&rdquo;
He opened the packet with his shaking yellow
fingers, and showed a little pinkish powder on the
paper. &ldquo;This,&rdquo; said he&mdash;&ldquo;well, you must guess
what it is. But Kummel&mdash;put but a dash of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
powder in it&mdash;is Himmel.&rdquo; His large greyish eyes
watched mine with an inscrutable expression.</p>

<p>It was a bit of a shock to me to find this great
teacher gave his mind to the flavour of liqueurs.
However, I feigned a great interest in his weakness,
for I was drunk enough for such small sycophancy.</p>

<p>He parted the powder between the little glasses,
and, rising suddenly, with a strange unexpected
dignity, held out his hand towards me. I imitated
his action, and the glasses rang. &ldquo;To a quick succession,&rdquo;
said he, and raised his glass towards his
lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not that,&rdquo; I said hastily. &ldquo;Not that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He paused, with the liqueur at the level of his
chin, and his eyes blazing into mine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To a long life,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>He hesitated. &ldquo;To a long life,&rdquo; said he, with a
sudden bark of laughter, and with eyes fixed on one
another we tilted the little glasses. His eyes looked
straight into mine, and as I drained the stuff off, I
felt a curiously intense sensation. The first touch
of it set my brain in a furious tumult; I seemed to
feel an actual physical stirring in my skull, and a
seething humming filled my ears. I did not notice
the flavour in my mouth, the aroma that filled my
throat; I saw only the grey intensity of his gaze
that burnt into mine. The draught, the mental confusion,
the noise and stirring in my head, seemed to
last an interminable time. Curious vague impressions
of half-forgotten things danced and vanished
on the edge of my consciousness. At last he broke
the spell. With a sudden explosive sigh he put
down his glass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s glorious,&rdquo; said I, though I had not tasted
the stuff.</p>

<p>My head was spinning. I sat down. My brain
was chaos. Then my perception grew clear and
minute as though I saw things in a concave mirror.
His manner seemed to have changed into something
nervous and hasty. He pulled out his watch and
grimaced at it. &ldquo;Eleven-seven! And to-night I
must&mdash;Seven&mdash;twenty-five. Waterloo! I must go
at once.&rdquo; He called for the bill, and struggled with
his coat. Officious waiters came to our assistance.
In another moment I was wishing him good-bye,
over the apron of a cab, and still with an absurd
feeling of minute distinctness, as though&mdash;how can I
express it?&mdash;I not only saw but <em>felt</em> through an
inverted opera-glass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That stuff,&rdquo; he said. He put his hand to his
forehead. &ldquo;I ought not to have given it to you.
It will make your head split to-morrow. Wait a
minute. Here.&rdquo; He handed me out a little flat
thing like a seidlitz-powder. &ldquo;Take that in water
as you are going to bed. The other thing was a
drug. Not till you&rsquo;re ready to go to bed, mind.
It will clear your head. That&rsquo;s all. One more shake&mdash;Futurus!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I gripped his shrivelled claw. &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; he
said, and by the droop of his eyelids I judged he
too was a little under the influence of that brain-twisting
cordial.</p>

<p>He recollected something else with a start, felt in
his breast-pocket, and produced another packet, this
time a cylinder the size and shape of a shaving-stick.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d almost forgotten. Don&rsquo;t open
this until I come to-morrow&mdash;but take it now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was so heavy that I well-nigh dropped it.
&ldquo;All ri&rsquo;!&rdquo; said I, and he grinned at me through the
cab window as the cabman flicked his horse into
wakefulness. It was a white packet he had given
me, with red seals at either end and along its edge.
&ldquo;If this isn&rsquo;t money,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s platinum or lead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I stuck it with elaborate care into my pocket,
and with a whirling brain walked home through the
Regent Street loiterers and the dark back streets
beyond Portland Road. I remember the sensations
of that walk very vividly, strange as they were. I
was still so far myself that I could notice my strange
mental state, and wonder whether this stuff I had
had was opium&mdash;a drug beyond my experience. It
is hard now to describe the peculiarity of my mental
strangeness&mdash;mental doubling vaguely expresses it.
As I was walking up Regent Street I found in my
mind a queer persuasion that it was Waterloo station,
and had an odd impulse to get into the Polytechnic
as a man might get into a train. I put a knuckle
in my eye, and it was Regent Street. How can I
express it? You see a skilful actor looking quietly
at you, he pulls a grimace, and lo!&mdash;another person.
Is it too extravagant if I tell you that it seemed to
me as if Regent Street had, for the moment, done
that? Then, being persuaded it was Regent Street
again, I was oddly muddled about some fantastic
reminiscences that cropped up. &ldquo;Thirty years ago,&rdquo;
thought I, &ldquo;it was here that I quarrelled with my
brother.&rdquo; Then I burst out laughing, to the astonishment
and encouragement of a group of night prowlers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Thirty years ago I did not exist, and never in my
life had I boasted a brother. The stuff was surely
liquid folly, for the poignant regret for that lost
brother still clung to me. Along Portland Road
the madness took another turn. I began to recall
vanished shops, and to compare the street with what
it used to be. Confused, troubled thinking is comprehensible
enough after the drink I had taken, but
what puzzled me were these curiously vivid phantasm
memories that had crept into my mind, and
not only the memories that had crept in, but also
the memories that had slipped out. I stopped opposite
Stevens&rsquo;, the natural history dealer&rsquo;s, and cudgelled
my brains to think what he had to do with me. A
&rsquo;bus went by, and sounded exactly like the rumbling
of a train. I seemed to be dipped into some dark,
remote pit for the recollection. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said I,
at last, &ldquo;he has promised me three frogs to-morrow.
Odd I should have forgotten.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Do they still show children dissolving views? In
those I remember one view would begin like a faint
ghost, and grow and oust another. In just that way
it seemed to me that a ghostly set of new sensations
was struggling with those of my ordinary self.</p>

<p>I went on through Euston Road to Tottenham
Court Road, puzzled, and a little frightened, and
scarcely noticed the unusual way I was taking, for
commonly I used to cut through the intervening
network of back streets. I turned into University
Street, to discover that I had forgotten my number.
Only by a strong effort did I recall 11<span class="f8">A</span>, and even
then it seemed to me that it was a thing some
forgotten person had told me. I tried to steady my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
mind by recalling the incidents of the dinner, and
for the life of me I could conjure up no picture of
my host&rsquo;s face; I saw him only as a shadowy outline,
as one might see oneself reflected in a window
through which one was looking. In his place, however,
I had a curious exterior vision of myself sitting
at a table, flushed, bright-eyed, and talkative.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must take this other powder,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;This
is getting impossible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I tried the wrong side of the hall for my candle
and the matches, and had a doubt of which landing
my room might be on. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m drunk,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
certain,&rdquo; and blundered needlessly on the staircase to
sustain the proposition.</p>

<p>At the first glance my room seemed unfamiliar.
&ldquo;What rot!&rdquo; I said, and stared about me. I seemed
to bring myself back by the effort, and the odd
phantasmal quality passed into the concrete familiar.
There was the old glass still, with my notes on the
albumens stuck in the corner of the frame, my old
everyday suit of clothes pitched about the floor.
And yet it was not so real after all. I felt an idiotic
persuasion trying to creep into my mind, as it were,
that I was in a railway carriage in a train just
stopping, that I was peering out of the window at
some unknown station. I gripped the bed-rail firmly
to reassure myself. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s clairvoyance, perhaps,&rdquo; I
said. &ldquo;I must write to the Psychical Research
Society.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I put the rouleau on my dressing-table, sat on
my bed and began to take off my boots. It was as
if the picture of my present sensations was painted
over some other picture that was trying to show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
through. &ldquo;Curse it!&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;my wits are going, or
am I in two places at once?&rdquo; Half-undressed, I
tossed the powder into a glass and drank it off. It
effervesced, and became a fluorescent amber colour.
Before I was in bed my mind was already tranquillised.
I felt the pillow at my cheek, and thereupon
I must have fallen asleep.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>I awoke abruptly out of a dream of strange beasts,
and found myself lying on my back. Probably
everyone knows that dismal, emotional dream from
which one escapes, awake indeed, but strangely cowed.
There was a curious taste in my mouth, a tired feeling
in my limbs, a sense of cutaneous discomfort. I
lay with my head motionless on my pillow, expecting
that my feeling of strangeness and terror would
probably pass away, and that I should then doze
off again to sleep. But instead of that, my uncanny
sensations increased. At first I could perceive
nothing wrong about me. There was a faint light
in the room, so faint that it was the very next thing
to darkness, and the furniture stood out in it as vague
blots of absolute darkness. I stared with my eyes
just over the bedclothes.</p>

<p>It came into my mind that someone had entered
the room to rob me of my rouleau of money, but
after lying for some moments, breathing regularly
to simulate sleep, I realised this was mere fancy.
Nevertheless, the uneasy assurance of something
wrong kept fast hold of me. With an effort I raised
my head from the pillow, and peered about me at
the dark. What it was I could not conceive. I
looked at the dim shapes around me, the greater and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
lesser darknesses that indicated curtains, table, fireplace,
bookshelves, and so forth. Then I began to
perceive something unfamiliar in the forms of the
darkness. Had the bed turned round? Yonder
should be the bookshelves, and something shrouded
and pallid rose there, something that would not
answer to the bookshelves, however I looked at it.
It was far too big to be my shirt thrown on a
chair.</p>

<p>Overcoming a childish terror, I threw back the
bedclothes and thrust my leg out of bed. Instead
of coming out of my truckle-bed upon the floor,
I found my foot scarcely reached the edge of the
mattress. I made another step, as it were, and sat
up on the edge of the bed. By the side of my bed
should be the candle, and the matches upon the
broken chair. I put out my hand and touched&mdash;nothing.
I waved my hand in the darkness, and it
came against some heavy hanging, soft and thick in
texture, which gave a rustling noise at my touch.
I grasped this and pulled it; it appeared to be
a curtain suspended over the head of my bed.</p>

<p>I was now thoroughly awake, and beginning to
realise that I was in a strange room. I was puzzled.
I tried to recall the overnight circumstances, and
I found them now, curiously enough, vivid in my
memory: the supper, my reception of the little
packages, my wonder whether I was intoxicated,
my slow undressing, the coolness to my flushed face
of my pillow. I felt a sudden distrust. Was that
last night, or the night before? At anyrate, this
room was strange to me, and I could not imagine
how I had got into it. The dim, pallid outline<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
was growing paler, and I perceived it was a window,
with the dark shape of an oval toilet-glass against
the weak intimation of the dawn that filtered through
the blind. I stood up, and was surprised by a
curious feeling of weakness and unsteadiness. With
trembling hands outstretched, I walked slowly towards
the window, getting, nevertheless, a bruise on the
knee from a chair by the way. I fumbled round the
glass, which was large, with handsome brass sconces,
to find the blind-cord. I could not find any. By
chance I took hold of the tassel, and with the click
of a spring the blind ran up.</p>

<p>I found myself looking out upon a scene that was
altogether strange to me. The night was overcast,
and through the flocculent grey of the heaped clouds
there filtered a faint half-light of dawn. Just at the
edge of the sky, the cloud-canopy had a blood-red
rim. Below, everything was dark and indistinct,
dim hills in the distance, a vague mass of buildings
running up into pinnacles, trees like spilt ink, and
below the window a tracery of black bushes and
pale grey paths. It was so unfamiliar that for the
moment I thought myself still dreaming. I felt the
toilet-table; it appeared to be made of some polished
wood, and was rather elaborately furnished&mdash;there
were little cut-glass bottles and a brush upon it.
There was also a queer little object, horse-shoe-shaped
it felt, with smooth, hard projections, lying
in a saucer. I could find no matches nor candlestick.</p>

<p>I turned my eyes to the room again. Now the
blind was up, faint spectres of its furnishing came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>out of the darkness. There was a huge curtained
bed, and the fireplace at its foot had a large white
mantel with something of the shimmer of marble.</p>

<p>I leant against the toilet-table, shut my eyes and
opened them again, and tried to think. The whole
thing was far too real for dreaming. I was inclined
to imagine there was still some hiatus in my memory,
as a consequence of my draught of that strange
liqueur; that I had come into my inheritance perhaps,
and suddenly lost my recollection of everything
since my good fortune had been announced. Perhaps
if I waited a little, things would be clearer to
me again. Yet my dinner with old Elvesham was
now singularly vivid and recent. The champagne,
the observant waiters, the powder, and the liqueurs&mdash;I
could have staked my soul it all happened a
few hours ago.</p>

<p>And then occurred a thing so trivial and yet so
terrible to me that I shiver now to think of that
moment. I spoke aloud. I said, &ldquo;How the devil
did I get here?&rdquo; ... <em>And the voice was not my
own.</em></p>

<p>It was not my own, it was thin, the articulation
was slurred, the resonance of my facial bones was
different. Then, to reassure myself I ran one hand
over the other, and felt loose folds of skin, the bony
laxity of age. &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; I said, in that horrible
voice that had somehow established itself in my
throat, &ldquo;surely this thing is a dream!&rdquo; Almost as
quickly as if I did it involuntarily, I thrust my
fingers into my mouth. My teeth had gone. My
finger-tips ran on the flaccid surface of an even
row of shrivelled gums. I was sick with dismay
and disgust.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>I felt then a passionate desire to see myself, to
realise at once in its full horror the ghastly change
that had come upon me. I tottered to the mantel,
and felt along it for matches. As I did so, a barking
cough sprang up in my throat, and I clutched the
thick flannel nightdress I found about me. There
were no matches there, and I suddenly realised that
my extremities were cold. Sniffing and coughing,
whimpering a little, perhaps, I fumbled back to bed.
&ldquo;It is surely a dream,&rdquo; I whimpered to myself as I
clambered back, &ldquo;surely a dream.&rdquo; It was a senile
repetition. I pulled the bedclothes over my shoulders,
over my ears, I thrust my withered hand under the
pillow, and determined to compose myself to sleep.
Of course it was a dream. In the morning the
dream would be over, and I should wake up strong
and vigorous again to my youth and studies. I
shut my eyes, breathed regularly, and, finding myself
wakeful, began to count slowly through the
powers of three.</p>

<p>But the thing I desired would not come. I could
not get to sleep. And the persuasion of the inexorable
reality of the change that had happened to me
grew steadily. Presently I found myself with my
eyes wide open, the powers of three forgotten, and
my skinny fingers upon my shrivelled gums. I was,
indeed, suddenly and abruptly, an old man. I had
in some unaccountable manner fallen through my life
and come to old age, in some way I had been cheated
of all the best of my life, of love, of struggle, of strength,
and hope. I grovelled into the pillow and tried to
persuade myself that such hallucination was possible.
Imperceptibly, steadily, the dawn grew clearer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>At last, despairing of further sleep, I sat up in
bed and looked about me. A chill twilight rendered
the whole chamber visible. It was spacious and
well-furnished, better furnished than any room I
had ever slept in before. A candle and matches
became dimly visible upon a little pedestal in a
recess. I threw back the bedclothes, and, shivering
with the rawness of the early morning, albeit it was
summer-time, I got out and lit the candle. Then,
trembling horribly, so that the extinguisher rattled
on its spike, I tottered to the glass and saw&mdash;<em>Elvesham&rsquo;s
face!</em> It was none the less horrible
because I had already dimly feared as much. He
had already seemed physically weak and pitiful to
me, but seen now, dressed only in a coarse flannel
nightdress that fell apart and showed the stringy
neck, seen now as my own body, I cannot describe
its desolate decrepitude. The hollow cheeks, the
straggling tail of dirty grey hair, the rheumy
bleared eyes, the quivering, shrivelled lips, the
lower displaying a gleam of the pink interior lining,
and those horrible dark gums showing. You
who are mind and body together, at your natural
years, cannot imagine what this fiendish imprisonment
meant to me. To be young and full of the
desire and energy of youth, and to be caught,
and presently to be crushed in this tottering ruin
of a body....</p>

<p>But I wander from the course of my story. For
some time I must have been stunned at this change
that had come upon me. It was daylight when I
did so far gather myself together as to think. In
some inexplicable way I had been changed, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
how, short of magic, the thing had been done, I
could not say. And as I thought, the diabolical
ingenuity of Elvesham came home to me. It seemed
plain to me that as I found myself in his, so he must
be in possession of <em>my</em> body, of my strength, that is,
and my future. But how to prove it? Then, as I
thought, the thing became so incredible, even to me,
that my mind reeled, and I had to pinch myself, to
feel my toothless gums, to see myself in the glass,
and touch the things about me, before I could steady
myself to face the facts again. Was all life hallucination?
Was I indeed Elvesham, and he me?
Had I been dreaming of Eden overnight? Was
there any Eden? But if I was Elvesham, I should
remember where I was on the previous morning, the
name of the town in which I lived, what happened
before the dream began. I struggled with my
thoughts. I recalled the queer doubleness of my
memories overnight. But now my mind was clear.
Not the ghost of any memories but those proper to
Eden could I raise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This way lies insanity!&rdquo; I cried in my piping
voice. I staggered to my feet, dragged my feeble,
heavy limbs to the washhand-stand, and plunged my
grey head into a basin of cold water. Then, towelling
myself, I tried again. It was no good. I felt
beyond all question that I was indeed Eden, not
Elvesham. But Eden in Elvesham&rsquo;s body!</p>

<p>Had I been a man of any other age, I might have
given myself up to my fate as one enchanted. But
in these sceptical days miracles do not pass current.
Here was some trick of psychology. What a drug
and a steady stare could do, a drug and a steady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
stare, or some similar treatment, could surely undo.
Men have lost their memories before. But to exchange
memories as one does umbrellas! I laughed.
Alas! not a healthy laugh, but a wheezing, senile
titter. I could have fancied old Elvesham laughing
at my plight, and a gust of petulant anger, unusual
to me, swept across my feelings. I began dressing
eagerly in the clothes I found lying about on the
floor, and only realised when I was dressed that it
was an evening suit I had assumed. I opened the
wardrobe and found some more ordinary clothes, a
pair of plaid trousers, and an old-fashioned dressing-gown.
I put a venerable smoking-cap on my venerable
head, and, coughing a little from my exertions,
tottered out upon the landing.</p>

<p>It was then, perhaps, a quarter to six, and the
blinds were closely drawn and the house quite silent.
The landing was a spacious one, a broad, richly-carpeted
staircase went down into the darkness of
the hall below, and before me a door ajar showed
me a writing-desk, a revolving bookcase, the back
of a study chair, and a fine array of bound books,
shelf upon shelf.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My study,&rdquo; I mumbled, and walked across the
landing. Then at the sound of my voice a thought
struck me, and I went back to the bedroom and put
in the set of false teeth. They slipped in with the
ease of old habit. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s better,&rdquo; said I, gnashing
them, and so returned to the study.</p>

<p>The drawers of the writing-desk were locked.
Its revolving top was also locked. I could see no
indications of the keys, and there were none in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>pockets of my trousers. I shuffled back at once to
the bedroom, and went through the dress suit, and
afterwards the pockets of all the garments I could
find. I was very eager, and one might have
imagined that burglars had been at work, to see
my room when I had done. Not only were there
no keys to be found, but not a coin, nor a scrap of
paper&mdash;save only the receipted bill of the overnight
dinner.</p>

<p>A curious weariness asserted itself. I sat down
and stared at the garments flung here and there,
their pockets turned inside out. My first frenzy had
already flickered out. Every moment I was beginning
to realise the immense intelligence of the plans
of my enemy, to see more and more clearly the
hopelessness of my position. With an effort I rose
and hurried hobbling into the study again. On the
staircase was a housemaid pulling up the blinds.
She stared, I think, at the expression of my face.
I shut the door of the study behind me, and, seizing
a poker, began an attack upon the desk. That is
how they found me. The cover of the desk was
split, the lock smashed, the letters torn out of the
pigeon-holes and tossed about the room. In my
senile rage I had flung about the pens and other
such light stationery, and overturned the ink. Moreover,
a large vase upon the mantel had got broken&mdash;I
do not know how. I could find no cheque-book,
no money, no indications of the slightest use
for the recovery of my body. I was battering madly
at the drawers, when the butler, backed by two women-servants,
intruded upon me.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>That simply is the story of my change. No one
will believe my frantic assertions. I am treated as
one demented, and even at this moment I am under
restraint. But I am sane, absolutely sane, and to
prove it I have sat down to write this story minutely
as the things happened to me. I appeal to the
reader, whether there is any trace of insanity in the
style or method of the story he has been reading.
I am a young man locked away in an old man&rsquo;s
body. But the clear fact is incredible to everyone.
Naturally I appear demented to those who will not
believe this, naturally I do not know the names of
my secretaries, of the doctors who come to see me,
of my servants and neighbours, of this town (wherever
it is) where I find myself. Naturally I lose
myself in my own house, and suffer inconveniences
of every sort. Naturally I ask the oddest questions.
Naturally I weep and cry out, and have paroxysms
of despair. I have no money and no cheque-book.
The bank will not recognise my signature, for I
suppose that, allowing for the feeble muscles I now
have, my handwriting is still Eden&rsquo;s. These people
about me will not let me go to the bank personally.
It seems, indeed, that there is no bank in this town,
and that I have an account in some part of London.
It seems that Elvesham kept the name of his
solicitor secret from all his household&mdash;I can ascertain
nothing. Elvesham was, of course, a profound
student of mental science, and all my declarations
of the facts of the case merely confirm the theory
that my insanity is the outcome of overmuch brooding
upon psychology. Dreams of the personal
identity indeed! Two days ago I was a healthy
youngster, with all life before me; now I am a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
furious old man, unkempt, and desperate, and miserable,
prowling about a great luxurious strange house,
watched, feared, and avoided as a lunatic by everyone
about me. And in London is Elvesham beginning
life again in a vigorous body, and with all the
accumulated knowledge and wisdom of threescore
and ten. He has stolen my life.</p>

<p>What has happened I do not clearly know. In
the study are volumes of manuscript notes referring
chiefly to the psychology of memory, and parts of
what may be either calculations or ciphers in symbols
absolutely strange to me. In some passages there
are indications that he was also occupied with the
philosophy of mathematics. I take it he has transferred
the whole of his memories, the accumulation
that makes up his personality, from this old withered
brain of his to mine, and, similarly, that he has
transferred mine to his discarded tenement. Practically,
that is, he has changed bodies. But how such
a change may be possible is without the range of my
philosophy. I have been a materialist for all my
thinking life, but here, suddenly, is a clear case of
man&rsquo;s detachability from matter.</p>

<p>One desperate experiment I am about to try. I
sit writing here before putting the matter to issue.
This morning, with the help of a table-knife that I
had secreted at breakfast, I succeeded in breaking
open a fairly obvious secret drawer in this wrecked
writing-desk. I discovered nothing save a little
green glass phial containing a white powder. Round
the neck of the phial was a label, and thereon was
written this one word, &ldquo;<em>Release</em>.&rdquo; This may be&mdash;is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>most probably, poison. I can understand Elvesham
placing poison in my way, and I should be
sure that it was his intention so to get rid of the
only living witness against him, were it not for this
careful concealment. The man has practically solved
the problem of immortality. Save for the spite of
chance, he will live in my body until it has aged,
and then, again, throwing that aside, he will assume
some other victim&rsquo;s youth and strength. When one
remembers his heartlessness, it is terrible to think of
the ever-growing experience, that.... How long has
he been leaping from body to body?... But I tire
of writing. The powder appears to be soluble in
water. The taste is not unpleasant.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>There the narrative found upon Mr. Elvesham&rsquo;s
desk ends. His dead body lay between the desk
and the chair. The latter had been pushed back,
probably by his last convulsions. The story was
written in pencil, and in a crazy hand, quite unlike
his usual minute characters. There remain only two
curious facts to record. Indisputably there was some
connection between Eden and Elvesham, since the
whole of Elvesham&rsquo;s property was bequeathed to the
young man. But he never inherited. When Elvesham
committed suicide, Eden was, strangely enough,
already dead. Twenty-four hours before, he had
been knocked down by a cab and killed instantly,
at the crowded crossing at the intersection of Gower
Street and Euston Road. So that the only human
being who could have thrown light upon this fantastic
narrative is beyond the reach of questions. Without
further comment I leave this extraordinary matter to
the reader&rsquo;s individual judgment.</p>

<h2><a name="IN_THE_ABYSS" id="IN_THE_ABYSS">IN THE ABYSS</a></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">The</span> lieutenant stood in front of the steel sphere
and gnawed a piece of pine splinter. &ldquo;What
do you think of it, Steevens?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an idea,&rdquo; said Steevens, in the tone of one
who keeps an open mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe it will smash&mdash;flat,&rdquo; said the lieutenant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He seems to have calculated it all out pretty
well,&rdquo; said Steevens, still impartial.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But think of the pressure,&rdquo; said the lieutenant.
&ldquo;At the surface of the water it&rsquo;s fourteen pounds
to the inch, thirty feet down it&rsquo;s double that;
sixty, treble; ninety, four times; nine hundred,
forty times; five thousand, three hundred&mdash;that&rsquo;s
a mile&mdash;it&rsquo;s two hundred and forty times fourteen
pounds; that&rsquo;s&mdash;let&rsquo;s see&mdash;thirty hundredweight&mdash;a
ton and a half, Steevens; <em>a ton and a half</em>
to the square inch. And the ocean where he&rsquo;s
going is five miles deep. That&rsquo;s seven and a
half&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sounds a lot,&rdquo; said Steevens, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s jolly thick
steel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lieutenant made no answer, but resumed his
pine splinter. The object of their conversation was
a huge ball of steel, having an exterior diameter of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
perhaps nine feet. It looked like the shot for some
Titanic piece of artillery. It was elaborately nested
in a monstrous scaffolding built into the framework
of the vessel, and the gigantic spars that were presently
to sling it overboard gave the stern of the
ship an appearance that had raised the curiosity of
every decent sailor who had sighted it, from the Pool
of London to the Tropic of Capricorn. In two
places, one above the other, the steel gave place to
a couple of circular windows of enormously thick
glass, and one of these, set in a steel frame of great
solidity, was now partially unscrewed. Both the
men had seen the interior of this globe for the first
time that morning. It was elaborately padded with
air cushions, with little studs sunk between bulging
pillows to work the simple mechanism of the affair.
Everything was elaborately padded, even the Myers
apparatus which was to absorb carbonic acid and
replace the oxygen inspired by its tenant, when he
had crept in by the glass manhole, and had been
screwed in. It was so elaborately padded that a
man might have been fired from a gun in it with
perfect safety. And it had need to be, for presently
a man was to crawl in through that glass manhole,
to be screwed up tightly, and to be flung overboard,
and to sink down&mdash;down&mdash;down, for five miles, even
as the lieutenant said. It had taken the strongest
hold of his imagination; it made him a bore at
mess; and he found Steevens, the new arrival
aboard, a godsend to talk to about it, over and
over again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my opinion,&rdquo; said the lieutenant, &ldquo;that that
glass will simply bend in and bulge and smash,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
under a pressure of that sort. Daubrée has made
rocks run like water under big pressures&mdash;and, you
mark my words&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the glass did break in,&rdquo; said Steevens, &ldquo;what
then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The water would shoot in like a jet of iron.
Have you ever felt a straight jet of high pressure
water? It would hit as hard as a bullet. It would
simply smash him and flatten him. It would tear
down his throat, and into his lungs; it would blow
in his ears&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a detailed imagination you have!&rdquo; protested
Steevens, who saw things vividly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a simple statement of the inevitable,&rdquo; said
the lieutenant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the globe?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would just give out a few little bubbles, and it
would settle down comfortably against the day of
judgment, among the oozes and the bottom clay&mdash;with
poor Elstead spread over his own smashed
cushions like butter over bread.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He repeated this sentence as though he liked
it very much. &ldquo;Like butter over bread,&rdquo; he
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Having a look at the jigger?&rdquo; said a voice,
and Elstead stood behind them, spick and span
in white, with a cigarette between his teeth, and
his eyes smiling out of the shadow of his ample
hat-brim. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that about bread and butter,
Weybridge? Grumbling as usual about the insufficient
pay of naval officers? It won&rsquo;t be more
than a day now before I start. We are to get the
slings ready to-day. This clean sky and gentle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
swell is just the kind of thing for swinging off a
dozen tons of lead and iron; isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t affect you much,&rdquo; said Weybridge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Seventy or eighty feet down, and I shall
be there in a dozen seconds, there&rsquo;s not a particle
moving, though the wind shriek itself hoarse up
above, and the water lifts halfway to the clouds.
No. Down there&rdquo;&mdash; He moved to the side of the
ship and the other two followed him. All three
leant forward on their elbows and stared down into
the yellow-green water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Peace</em>,&rdquo; said Elstead, finishing his thought aloud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you dead certain that clockwork will act?&rdquo;
asked Weybridge presently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has worked thirty-five times,&rdquo; said Elstead.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s bound to work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if it doesn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t go down in that confounded thing,&rdquo;
said Weybridge, &ldquo;for twenty thousand pounds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cheerful chap you are,&rdquo; said Elstead, and spat
sociably at a bubble below.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand yet how you mean to work
the thing,&rdquo; said Steevens.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the first place, I&rsquo;m screwed into the sphere,&rdquo;
said Elstead, &ldquo;and when I&rsquo;ve turned the electric light
off and on three times to show I&rsquo;m cheerful, I&rsquo;m
swung out over the stern by that crane, with all
those big lead sinkers slung below me. The top
lead weight has a roller carrying a hundred fathoms
of strong cord rolled up, and that&rsquo;s all that joins the
sinkers to the sphere, except the slings that will be
cut when the affair is dropped. We use cord rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
than wire rope because it&rsquo;s easier to cut and more
buoyant&mdash;necessary points, as you will see.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Through each of these lead weights you notice
there is a hole, and an iron rod will be run through
that and will project six feet on the lower side. If
that rod is rammed up from below, it knocks up a
lever and sets the clockwork in motion at the side of
the cylinder on which the cord winds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well. The whole affair is lowered gently
into the water, and the slings are cut. The sphere
floats,&mdash;with the air in it, it&rsquo;s lighter than water,&mdash;but
the lead weights go down straight and the cord runs
out. When the cord is all paid out, the sphere will
go down too, pulled down by the cord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why the cord?&rdquo; asked Steevens. &ldquo;Why
not fasten the weights directly to the sphere?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because of the smash down below. The whole
affair will go rushing down, mile after mile, at a
headlong pace at last. It would be knocked to
pieces on the bottom if it wasn&rsquo;t for that cord. But
the weights will hit the bottom, and directly they
do, the buoyancy of the sphere will come into play.
It will go on sinking slower and slower; come to
a stop at last, and then begin to float upward
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where the clockwork comes in. Directly
the weights smash against the sea bottom, the rod
will be knocked through and will kick up the clockwork,
and the cord will be rewound on the reel. I
shall be lugged down to the sea bottom. There I
shall stay for half an hour, with the electric light on,
looking about me. Then the clockwork will release
a spring knife, the cord will be cut, and up I shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
rush again, like a soda-water bubble. The cord
itself will help the flotation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if you should chance to hit a ship?&rdquo; said
Weybridge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should come up at such a pace, I should go
clean through it,&rdquo; said Elstead, &ldquo;like a cannon ball.
You needn&rsquo;t worry about that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And suppose some nimble crustacean should
wriggle into your clockwork&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be a pressing sort of invitation for
me to stop,&rdquo; said Elstead, turning his back on the
water and staring at the sphere.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>They had swung Elstead overboard by eleven
o&rsquo;clock. The day was serenely bright and calm, with
the horizon lost in haze. The electric glare in the
little upper compartment beamed cheerfully three
times. Then they let him down slowly to the
surface of the water, and a sailor in the stern chains
hung ready to cut the tackle that held the lead
weights and the sphere together. The globe, which
had looked so large on deck, looked the smallest
thing conceivable under the stern of the ship. It
rolled a little, and its two dark windows, which
floated uppermost, seemed like eyes turned up in
round wonderment at the people who crowded the
rail. A voice wondered how Elstead liked the
rolling. &ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo; sang out the commander.
&ldquo;Ay, ay, sir!&rdquo; &ldquo;Then let her go!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The rope of the tackle tightened against the blade
and was cut, and an eddy rolled over the globe in
a grotesquely helpless fashion. Someone waved a
handkerchief, someone else tried an ineffectual cheer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
a middy was counting slowly, &ldquo;Eight, nine, ten!&rdquo;
Another roll, then with a jerk and a splash the thing
righted itself.</p>

<p>It seemed to be stationary for a moment, to grow
rapidly smaller, and then the water closed over it,
and it became visible, enlarged by refraction and
dimmer, below the surface. Before one could count
three it had disappeared. There was a flicker of
white light far down in the water, that diminished to
a speck and vanished. Then there was nothing but
a depth of water going down into blackness, through
which a shark was swimming.</p>

<p>Then suddenly the screw of the cruiser began to
rotate, the water was crickled, the shark disappeared
in a wrinkled confusion, and a torrent of foam rushed
across the crystalline clearness that had swallowed
up Elstead. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the idee?&rdquo; said one A.B. to
another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to lay off about a couple of miles, &rsquo;fear
he should hit us when he comes up,&rdquo; said his mate.</p>

<p>The ship steamed slowly to her new position.
Aboard her almost everyone who was unoccupied
remained watching the breathing swell into which
the sphere had sunk. For the next half-hour it is
doubtful if a word was spoken that did not bear
directly or indirectly on Elstead. The December
sun was now high in the sky, and the heat very
considerable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be cold enough down there,&rdquo; said Weybridge.
&ldquo;They say that below a certain depth sea
water&rsquo;s always just about freezing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;ll he come up?&rdquo; asked Steevens. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
lost my bearings.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the spot,&rdquo; said the commander, who
prided himself on his omniscience. He extended
a precise finger south-eastward. &ldquo;And this, I
reckon, is pretty nearly the moment,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
been thirty-five minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long does it take to reach the bottom of
the ocean?&rdquo; asked Steevens.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For a depth of five miles, and reckoning&mdash;as we
did&mdash;an acceleration of two feet per second, both
ways, is just about three-quarters of a minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then he&rsquo;s overdue,&rdquo; said Weybridge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pretty nearly,&rdquo; said the commander. &ldquo;I suppose
it takes a few minutes for that cord of his to
wind in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I forgot that,&rdquo; said Weybridge, evidently relieved.</p>

<p>And then began the suspense. A minute slowly
dragged itself out, and no sphere shot out of the
water. Another followed, and nothing broke the
low oily swell. The sailors explained to one another
that little point about the winding-in of the cord.
The rigging was dotted with expectant faces.
&ldquo;Come up, Elstead!&rdquo; called one hairy-chested salt
impatiently, and the others caught it up, and shouted
as though they were waiting for the curtain of a
theatre to rise.</p>

<p>The commander glanced irritably at them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, if the acceleration&rsquo;s less than two,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll be all the longer. We aren&rsquo;t absolutely
certain that was the proper figure. I&rsquo;m no slavish
believer in calculations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Steevens agreed concisely. No one on the
quarter-deck spoke for a couple of minutes. Then
Steevens&rsquo; watchcase clicked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>When, twenty-one minutes after, the sun reached
the zenith, they were still waiting for the globe to
reappear, and not a man aboard had dared to
whisper that hope was dead. It was Weybridge
who first gave expression to that realisation. He
spoke while the sound of eight bells still hung in the
air. &ldquo;I always distrusted that window,&rdquo; he said quite
suddenly to Steevens.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; said Steevens; &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t think&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said Weybridge, and left the rest to his
imagination.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m no great believer in calculations myself,&rdquo;
said the commander dubiously, &ldquo;so that I&rsquo;m not
altogether hopeless yet.&rdquo; And at midnight the
gunboat was steaming slowly in a spiral round the
spot where the globe had sunk, and the white beam
of the electric light fled and halted and swept discontentedly
onward again over the waste of phosphorescent
waters under the little stars.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If his window hasn&rsquo;t burst and smashed him,&rdquo;
said Weybridge, &ldquo;then it&rsquo;s a cursed sight worse, for
his clockwork has gone wrong, and he&rsquo;s alive now,
five miles under our feet, down there in the cold and
dark, anchored in that little bubble of his, where
never a ray of light has shone or a human being
lived, since the waters were gathered together. He&rsquo;s
there without food, feeling hungry and thirsty and
scared, wondering whether he&rsquo;ll starve or stifle.
Which will it be? The Myers apparatus is running
out, I suppose. How long do they last?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;what little
things we are! What daring little devils! Down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
there, miles and miles of water&mdash;all water, and all
this empty water about us and this sky. Gulfs!&rdquo;
He threw his hands out, and as he did so, a little
white streak swept noiselessly up the sky, travelled
more slowly, stopped, became a motionless dot, as
though a new star had fallen up into the sky.
Then it went sliding back again and lost itself
amidst the reflections of the stars and the white
haze of the sea&rsquo;s phosphorescence.</p>

<p>At the sight he stopped, arm extended and mouth
open. He shut his mouth, opened it again, and
waved his arms with an impatient gesture. Then he
turned, shouted &ldquo;El-stead ahoy!&rdquo; to the first watch,
and went at a run to Lindley and the search-light.
&ldquo;I saw him,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Starboard there! His
light&rsquo;s on, and he&rsquo;s just shot out of the water. Bring
the light round. We ought to see him drifting,
when he lifts on the swell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But they never picked up the explorer until dawn.
Then they almost ran him down. The crane was
swung out and a boat&rsquo;s crew hooked the chain to the
sphere. When they had shipped the sphere, they
unscrewed the manhole and peered into the darkness
of the interior (for the electric light chamber was
intended to illuminate the water about the sphere,
and was shut off entirely from its general cavity).</p>

<p>The air was very hot within the cavity, and the
indiarubber at the lip of the manhole was soft.
There was no answer to their eager questions and
no sound of movement within. Elstead seemed to
be lying motionless, crumpled up in the bottom of
the globe. The ship&rsquo;s doctor crawled in and lifted
him out to the men outside. For a moment or so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
they did not know whether Elstead was alive or
dead. His face, in the yellow light of the ship&rsquo;s
lamps, glistened with perspiration. They carried
him down to his own cabin.</p>

<p>He was not dead, they found, but in a state of
absolute nervous collapse, and besides cruelly bruised.
For some days he had to lie perfectly still. It was
a week before he could tell his experiences.</p>

<p>Almost his first words were that he was going
down again. The sphere would have to be altered,
he said, in order to allow him to throw off the cord
if need be, and that was all. He had had the most
marvellous experience. &ldquo;You thought I should find
nothing but ooze,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You laughed at my
explorations, and I&rsquo;ve discovered a new world!&rdquo;
He told his story in disconnected fragments, and
chiefly from the wrong end, so that it is impossible
to re-tell it in his words. But what follows is the
narrative of his experience.</p>

<p>It began atrociously, he said. Before the cord
ran out, the thing kept rolling over. He felt like a
frog in a football. He could see nothing but the
crane and the sky overhead, with an occasional
glimpse of the people on the ship&rsquo;s rail. He
couldn&rsquo;t tell a bit which way the thing would roll
next. Suddenly he would find his feet going up,
and try to step, and over he went rolling, head over
heels, and just anyhow, on the padding. Any other
shape would have been more comfortable, but no
other shape was to be relied upon under the huge
pressure of the nethermost abyss.</p>

<p>Suddenly the swaying ceased; the globe righted,
and when he had picked himself up, he saw the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
water all about him greeny-blue, with an attenuated
light filtering down from above, and a shoal of little
floating things went rushing up past him, as it
seemed to him, towards the light. And even as
he looked, it grew darker and darker, until the water
above was as dark as the midnight sky, albeit of a
greener shade, and the water below black. And
little transparent things in the water developed a
faint glint of luminosity, and shot past him in faint
greenish streaks.</p>

<p>And the feeling of falling! It was just like the
start of a lift, he said, only it kept on. One has to
imagine what that means, that keeping on. It was
then of all times that Elstead repented of his
adventure. He saw the chances against him in an
altogether new light. He thought of the big cuttlefish
people knew to exist in the middle waters, the
kind of things they find half digested in whales at
times, or floating dead and rotten and half eaten by
fish. Suppose one caught hold and wouldn&rsquo;t let
go. And had the clockwork really been sufficiently
tested? But whether he wanted to go on or to go
back mattered not the slightest now.</p>

<p>In fifty seconds everything was as black as night
outside, except where the beam from his light struck
through the waters, and picked out every now and
then some fish or scrap of sinking matter. They
flashed by too fast for him to see what they were.
Once he thinks he passed a shark. And then the
sphere began to get hot by friction against the water.
They had underestimated this, it seems.</p>

<p>The first thing he noticed was that he was perspiring,
and then he heard a hissing growing louder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
under his feet, and saw a lot of little bubbles&mdash;very
little bubbles they were&mdash;rushing upward like a fan
through the water outside. Steam! He felt the
window, and it was hot. He turned on the minute
glow-lamp that lit his own cavity, looked at the
padded watch by the studs, and saw he had been
travelling now for two minutes. It came into his
head that the window would crack through the
conflict of temperatures, for he knew the bottom
water is very near freezing.</p>

<p>Then suddenly the floor of the sphere seemed to
press against his feet, the rush of bubbles outside
grew slower and slower, and the hissing diminished.
The sphere rolled a little. The window had not
cracked, nothing had given, and he knew that the
dangers of sinking, at anyrate, were over.</p>

<p>In another minute or so he would be on the floor
of the abyss. He thought, he said, of Steevens and
Weybridge and the rest of them five miles overhead,
higher to him than the very highest clouds that ever
floated over land are to us, steaming slowly and
staring down and wondering what had happened to
him.</p>

<p>He peered out of the window. There were no
more bubbles now, and the hissing had stopped.
Outside there was a heavy blackness&mdash;as black as
black velvet&mdash;except where the electric light pierced
the empty water and showed the colour of it&mdash;a
yellow-green. Then three things like shapes of fire
swam into sight, following each other through the
water. Whether they were little and near or big
and far off he could not tell.</p>

<p>Each was outlined in a bluish light almost as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
bright as the lights of a fishing smack, a light which
seemed to be smoking greatly, and all along the sides
of them were specks of this, like the lighter portholes
of a ship. Their phosphorescence seemed to go out
as they came into the radiance of his lamp, and he
saw then that they were little fish of some strange
sort, with huge heads, vast eyes, and dwindling
bodies and tails. Their eyes were turned towards
him, and he judged they were following him down.
He supposed they were attracted by his glare.</p>

<p>Presently others of the same sort joined them.
As he went on down, he noticed that the water
became of a pallid colour, and that little specks
twinkled in his ray like motes in a sunbeam. This
was probably due to the clouds of ooze and mud
that the impact of his leaden sinkers had disturbed.</p>

<p>By the time he was drawn down to the lead
weights he was in a dense fog of white that his
electric light failed altogether to pierce for more than
a few yards, and many minutes elapsed before the
hanging sheets of sediment subsided to any extent.
Then, lit by his light and by the transient phosphorescence
of a distant shoal of fishes, he was able
to see under the huge blackness of the super-incumbent
water an undulating expanse of greyish-white
ooze, broken here and there by tangled thickets of a
growth of sea lilies, waving hungry tentacles in the
air.</p>

<p>Farther away were the graceful, translucent outlines
of a group of gigantic sponges. About this
floor there were scattered a number of bristling
flattish tufts of rich purple and black, which he
decided must be some sort of sea-urchin, and small,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
large-eyed or blind things having a curious resemblance,
some to woodlice, and others to lobsters,
crawled sluggishly across the track of the light and
vanished into the obscurity again, leaving furrowed
trails behind them.</p>

<p>Then suddenly the hovering swarm of little fishes
veered about and came towards him as a flight of
starlings might do. They passed over him like a
phosphorescent snow, and then he saw behind them
some larger creature advancing towards the sphere.</p>

<p>At first he could see it only dimly, a faintly
moving figure remotely suggestive of a walking
man, and then it came into the spray of light that
the lamp shot out. As the glare struck it, it shut
its eyes, dazzled. He stared in rigid astonishment.</p>

<p>It was a strange vertebrated animal. Its dark
purple head was dimly suggestive of a chameleon,
but it had such a high forehead and such a braincase
as no reptile ever displayed before; the vertical
pitch of its face gave it a most extraordinary resemblance
to a human being.</p>

<p>Two large and protruding eyes projected from
sockets in chameleon fashion, and it had a broad
reptilian mouth with horny lips beneath its little
nostrils. In the position of the ears were two huge
gill-covers, and out of these floated a branching tree
of coralline filaments, almost like the tree-like gills
that very young rays and sharks possess.</p>

<p>But the humanity of the face was not the most
extraordinary thing about the creature. It was a
biped; its almost globular body was poised on a
tripod of two frog-like legs and a long thick tail,
and its fore limbs, which grotesquely caricatured the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
human hand, much as a frog&rsquo;s do, carried a long
shaft of bone, tipped with copper. The colour of
the creature was variegated; its head, hands, and
legs were purple; but its skin, which hung loosely
upon it, even as clothes might do, was a phosphorescent
grey. And it stood there blinded by
the light.</p>

<p>At last this unknown creature of the abyss
blinked its eyes open, and, shading them with its
disengaged hand, opened its mouth and gave vent
to a shouting noise, articulate almost as speech
might be, that penetrated even the steel case and
padded jacket of the sphere. How a shouting may
be accomplished without lungs Elstead does not
profess to explain. It then moved sideways out
of the glare into the mystery of shadow that
bordered it on either side, and Elstead felt rather
than saw that it was coming towards him. Fancying
the light had attracted it, he turned the switch
that cut off the current. In another moment something
soft dabbed upon the steel, and the globe
swayed.</p>

<p>Then the shouting was repeated, and it seemed
to him that a distant echo answered it. The dabbing
recurred, and the globe swayed and ground
against the spindle over which the wire was rolled.
He stood in the blackness and peered out into the
everlasting night of the abyss. And presently he
saw, very faint and remote, other phosphorescent
quasi-human forms hurrying towards him.</p>

<p>Hardly knowing what he did, he felt about in his
swaying prison for the stud of the exterior electric
light, and came by accident against his own small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
glow-lamp in its padded recess. The sphere twisted,
and then threw him down; he heard shouts like
shouts of surprise, and when he rose to his feet, he
saw two pairs of stalked eyes peering into the lower
window and reflecting his light.</p>

<p>In another moment hands were dabbing vigorously
at his steel casing, and there was a sound, horrible
enough in his position, of the metal protection of
the clockwork being vigorously hammered. That,
indeed, sent his heart into his mouth, for if these
strange creatures succeeded in stopping that, his
release would never occur. Scarcely had he thought
as much when he felt the sphere sway violently, and
the floor of it press hard against his feet. He turned
off the small glow-lamp that lit the interior, and sent
the ray of the large light in the separate compartment
out into the water. The sea-floor and the
man-like creatures had disappeared, and a couple
of fish chasing each other dropped suddenly by the
window.</p>

<p>He thought at once that these strange denizens
of the deep sea had broken the rope, and that he
had escaped. He drove up faster and faster, and
then stopped with a jerk that sent him flying against
the padded roof of his prison. For half a minute,
perhaps, he was too astonished to think.</p>

<p>Then he felt that the sphere was spinning slowly,
and rocking, and it seemed to him that it was also
being drawn through the water. By crouching close
to the window, he managed to make his weight
effective and roll that part of the sphere downward,
but he could see nothing save the pale ray of his
light striking down ineffectively into the darkness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
It occurred to him that he would see more if he
turned the lamp off, and allowed his eyes to grow
accustomed to the profound obscurity.</p>

<p>In this he was wise. After some minutes the
velvety blackness became a translucent blackness,
and then, far away, and as faint as the zodiacal light
of an English summer evening, he saw shapes
moving below. He judged these creatures had
detached his cable, and were towing him along the
sea bottom.</p>

<p>And then he saw something faint and remote
across the undulations of the submarine plain, a
broad horizon of pale luminosity that extended
this way and that way as far as the range of his
little window permitted him to see. To this he was
being towed, as a balloon might be towed by men
out of the open country into a town. He approached
it very slowly, and very slowly the dim irradiation
was gathered together into more definite shapes.</p>

<p>It was nearly five o&rsquo;clock before he came over
this luminous area, and by that time he could
make out an arrangement suggestive of streets
and houses grouped about a vast roofless erection
that was grotesquely suggestive of a ruined
abbey. It was spread out like a map below
him. The houses were all roofless enclosures of
walls, and their substance being, as he afterwards
saw, of phosphorescent bones, gave the
place an appearance as if it were built of drowned
moonshine.</p>

<p>Among the inner caves of the place waving
trees of crinoid stretched their tentacles, and tall,
slender, glassy sponges shot like shining minarets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
and lilies of filmy light out of the general glow of
the city. In the open spaces of the place he could
see a stirring movement as of crowds of people, but
he was too many fathoms above them to distinguish
the individuals in those crowds.</p>

<p>Then slowly they pulled him down, and as they
did so, the details of the place crept slowly upon
his apprehension. He saw that the courses of the
cloudy buildings were marked out with beaded
lines of round objects, and then he perceived that at
several points below him, in broad open spaces, were
forms like the encrusted shapes of ships.</p>

<p>Slowly and surely he was drawn down, and the
forms below him became brighter, clearer, more distinct.
He was being pulled down, he perceived,
towards the large building in the centre of the town,
and he could catch a glimpse ever and again of the
multitudinous forms that were lugging at his cord.
He was astonished to see that the rigging of one of
the ships, which formed such a prominent feature of
the place, was crowded with a host of gesticulating
figures regarding him, and then the walls of the
great building rose about him silently, and hid the
city from his eyes.</p>

<p>And such walls they were, of water-logged wood,
and twisted wire-rope, and iron spars, and copper,
and the bones and skulls of dead men. The skulls
ran in zigzag lines and spirals and fantastic curves
over the building; and in and out of their eye-sockets,
and over the whole surface of the place, lurked and
played a multitude of silvery little fishes.</p>

<p>Suddenly his ears were filled with a low shouting
and a noise like the violent blowing of horns, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
this gave place to a fantastic chant. Down the
sphere sank, past the huge pointed windows, through
which he saw vaguely a great number of these
strange, ghostlike people regarding him, and at
last he came to rest, as it seemed, on a kind of
altar that stood in the centre of the place.</p>

<p>And now he was at such a level that he could
see these strange people of the abyss plainly once
more. To his astonishment, he perceived that they
were prostrating themselves before him, all save one,
dressed as it seemed in a robe of placoid scales,
and crowned with a luminous diadem, who stood
with his reptilian mouth opening and shutting, as
though he led the chanting of the worshippers.</p>

<p>A curious impulse made Elstead turn on his
small glow-lamp again, so that he became visible
to these creatures of the abyss, albeit the glare
made them disappear forthwith into night. At this
sudden sight of him, the chanting gave place to a
tumult of exultant shouts; and Elstead, being
anxious to watch them, turned his light off again,
and vanished from before their eyes. But for a
time he was too blind to make out what they were
doing, and when at last he could distinguish them,
they were kneeling again. And thus they continued
worshipping him, without rest or intermission,
for the space of three hours.</p>

<p>Most circumstantial was Elstead&rsquo;s account of this
astounding city and its people, these people of
perpetual night, who have never seen sun or moon
or stars, green vegetation, nor any living, air-breathing
creatures, who know nothing of fire, nor any light
but the phosphorescent light of living things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>Startling as is his story, it is yet more startling
to find that scientific men, of such eminence as
Adams and Jenkins, find nothing incredible in it.
They tell me they see no reason why intelligent,
water-breathing, vertebrated creatures, inured to a
low temperature and enormous pressure, and of such
a heavy structure, that neither alive nor dead would
they float, might not live upon the bottom of the
deep sea, and quite unsuspected by us, descendants
like ourselves of the great Theriomorpha of the New
Red Sandstone age.</p>

<p>We should be known to them, however, as strange,
meteoric creatures, wont to fall catastrophically dead
out of the mysterious blackness of their watery sky.
And not only we ourselves, but our ships, our
metals, our appliances, would come raining down
out of the night. Sometimes sinking things would
smite down and crush them, as if it were the judgment
of some unseen power above, and sometimes
would come things of the utmost rarity or utility,
or shapes of inspiring suggestion. One can understand,
perhaps, something of their behaviour at the
descent of a living man, if one thinks what a barbaric
people might do, to whom an enhaloed, shining creature
came suddenly out of the sky.</p>

<p>At one time or another Elstead probably told the
officers of the <i>Ptarmigan</i> every detail of his strange
twelve hours in the abyss. That he also intended to
write them down is certain, but he never did, and so
unhappily we have to piece together the discrepant
fragments of his story from the reminiscences of
Commander Simmons, Weybridge, Steevens, Lindley,
and the others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>We see the thing darkly in fragmentary glimpses&mdash;the
huge ghostly building, the bowing, chanting people,
with their dark chameleon-like heads and faintly
luminous clothing, and Elstead, with his light turned
on again, vainly trying to convey to their minds
that the cord by which the sphere was held was to
be severed. Minute after minute slipped away, and
Elstead, looking at his watch, was horrified to find
that he had oxygen only for four hours more. But
the chant in his honour kept on as remorselessly as
if it was the marching song of his approaching death.</p>

<p>The manner of his release he does not understand,
but to judge by the end of cord that hung from the
sphere, it had been cut through by rubbing against
the edge of the altar. Abruptly the sphere rolled
over, and he swept up, out of their world, as an
ethereal creature clothed in a vacuum would sweep
through our own atmosphere back to its native ether
again. He must have torn out of their sight as a
hydrogen bubble hastens upward from our air. A
strange ascension it must have seemed to them.</p>

<p>The sphere rushed up with even greater velocity
than, when weighted with the lead sinkers, it had
rushed down. It became exceedingly hot. It drove
up with the windows uppermost, and he remembers
the torrent of bubbles frothing against the glass.
Every moment he expected this to fly. Then
suddenly something like a huge wheel seemed to
be released in his head, the padded compartment
began spinning about him, and he fainted. His
next recollection was of his cabin, and of the
doctor&rsquo;s voice.</p>

<p>But that is the substance of the extraordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
story that Elstead related in fragments to the
officers of the <i>Ptarmigan</i>. He promised to write
it all down at a later date. His mind was chiefly
occupied with the improvement of his apparatus,
which was effected at Rio.</p>

<p>It remains only to tell that on February 2,
1896, he made his second descent into the ocean
abyss, with the improvements his first experience
suggested. What happened we shall probably never
know. He never returned. The <i>Ptarmigan</i> beat
about over the point of his submersion, seeking him
in vain for thirteen days. Then she returned to
Rio, and the news was telegraphed to his friends.
So the matter remains for the present. But it is
hardly probable that no further attempt will be
made to verify his strange story of these hitherto
unsuspected cities of the deep sea.</p>

corner of the carriage, abruptly breaking the
silence.</p>

<p>Mr. Hinchcliff looked up, hearing imperfectly.
He had been lost in the rapt contemplation of the
college cap tied by a string to his portmanteau
handles&mdash;the outward and visible sign of his newly-gained
pedagogic position&mdash;in the rapt appreciation
of the college cap and the pleasant anticipations it
excited. For Mr. Hinchcliff had just matriculated
at London University, and was going to be junior
assistant at the Holmwood Grammar School&mdash;a
very enviable position. He stared across the carriage
at his fellow-traveller.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not give it away?&rdquo; said this person.
&ldquo;Give it away! Why not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was a tall, dark, sunburnt man with a pale
face. His arms were folded tightly, and his feet
were on the seat in front of him. He was pulling
at a lank black moustache. He stared hard at his
toes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Mr. Hinchcliff coughed.</p>

<p>The stranger lifted his eyes&mdash;they were curious,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
dark-grey eyes&mdash;and stared blankly at Mr. Hinchcliff
for the best part of a minute, perhaps. His
expression grew to interest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;Why not? And end
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite follow you, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; said Mr.
Hinchcliff, with another cough.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t quite follow me?&rdquo; said the stranger
quite mechanically, his singular eyes wandering from
Mr. Hinchcliff to the bag with its ostentatiously
displayed cap, and back to Mr. Hinchcliff&rsquo;s downy
face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so abrupt, you know,&rdquo; apologised Mr
Hinchcliff.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; said the stranger, following
his thoughts. &ldquo;You are a student?&rdquo; he said, addressing
Mr. Hinchcliff.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am&mdash;by Correspondence&mdash;of the London
University,&rdquo; said Mr. Hinchcliff, with irrepressible
pride, and feeling nervously at his tie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In pursuit of knowledge,&rdquo; said the stranger, and
suddenly took his feet off the seat, put his fist on
his knees, and stared at Mr. Hinchcliff as though he
had never seen a student before. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said,
and flung out an index finger. Then he rose, took
a bag from the hat-rack, and unlocked it. Quite
silently he drew out something round and wrapped
in a quantity of silver-paper, and unfolded this carefully.
He held it out towards Mr. Hinchcliff&mdash;a
small, very smooth, golden-yellow fruit.</p>

<p>Mr. Hinchcliff&rsquo;s eyes and mouth were open. He
did not offer to take this object&mdash;if he was intended
to take it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said this fantastic stranger, speaking very
slowly, &ldquo;is the Apple of the Tree of Knowledge.
Look at it&mdash;small, and bright, and wonderful&mdash;Knowledge&mdash;and
I am going to give it to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Hinchcliff&rsquo;s mind worked painfully for a
minute, and then the sufficient explanation, &ldquo;Mad!&rdquo;
flashed across his brain, and illuminated the whole
situation. One humoured madmen. He put his
head a little on one side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Apple of the Tree of Knowledge, eigh!&rdquo;
said Mr. Hinchcliff, regarding it with a finely
assumed air of interest, and then looking at the
interlocutor. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you want to eat it yourself?
And besides&mdash;how did you come by it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It never fades. I have had it now three months.
And it is ever bright and smooth and ripe and
desirable, as you see it.&rdquo; He laid his hand on his
knee and regarded the fruit musingly. Then he
began to wrap it again in the papers, as though
he had abandoned his intention of giving it away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how did you come by it?&rdquo; said Mr. Hinchcliff,
who had his argumentative side. &ldquo;And how
do you know that it <em>is</em> the Fruit of the Tree?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I bought this fruit,&rdquo; said the stranger, &ldquo;three
months ago&mdash;for a drink of water and a crust of
bread. The man who gave it to me&mdash;because I
kept the life in him&mdash;was an Armenian. Armenia!
that wonderful country, the first of all countries,
where the ark of the Flood remains to this day,
buried in the glaciers of Mount Ararat. This man,
I say, fleeing with others from the Kurds who had
come upon them, went up into desolate places among
the mountains&mdash;places beyond the common knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
of men. And fleeing from imminent pursuit,
they came to a slope high among the mountain-peaks,
green with a grass like knife-blades, that cut
and slashed most pitilessly at anyone who went into
it. The Kurds were close behind, and there was
nothing for it but to plunge in, and the worst of it
was that the paths they made through it at the price
of their blood served for the Kurds to follow. Every
one of the fugitives was killed save this Armenian
and another. He heard the screams and cries of
his friends, and the swish of the grass about those
who were pursuing them&mdash;it was tall grass rising
overhead. And then a shouting and answers, and
when presently he paused, everything was still. He
pushed out again, not understanding, cut and bleeding,
until he came out on a steep slope of rocks
below a precipice, and then he saw the grass was all
on fire, and the smoke of it rose like a veil between
him and his enemies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The stranger paused. &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; said Mr. Hinchcliff.
&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There he was, all torn and bloody from the
knife-blades of the grass, the rocks blazing under
the afternoon sun&mdash;the sky molten brass&mdash;and the
smoke of the fire driving towards him. He dared
not stay there. Death he did not mind, but torture!
Far away beyond the smoke he heard shouts and
cries. Women screaming. So he went clambering
up a gorge in the rocks&mdash;everywhere were bushes
with dry branches that stuck out like thorns among
the leaves&mdash;until he clambered over the brow of a
ridge that hid him. And then he met his companion,
a shepherd, who had also escaped. And, counting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
cold and famine and thirst as nothing against the
Kurds, they went on into the heights, and among
the snow and ice. They wandered three whole
days.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The third day came the vision. I suppose
hungry men often do see visions, but then there is
this fruit.&rdquo; He lifted the wrapped globe in his
hand. &ldquo;And I have heard it, too, from other
mountaineers who have known something of the
legend. It was in the evening time, when the stars
were increasing, that they came down a slope of
polished rock into a huge dark valley all set about
with strange, contorted trees, and in these trees
hung little globes like glow-worm spheres, strange
round yellow lights.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suddenly this valley was lit far away, many
miles away, far down it, with a golden flame marching
slowly athwart it, that made the stunted trees
against it black as night, and turned the slopes all
about them and their figures to the likeness of fiery
gold. And at the vision they, knowing the legends
of the mountains, instantly knew that it was Eden
they saw, or the sentinel of Eden, and they fell
upon their faces like men struck dead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When they dared to look again the valley was
dark for a space, and then the light came again&mdash;returning,
a burning amber.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At that the shepherd sprang to his feet, and
with a shout began to run down towards the light,
but the other man was too fearful to follow him.
He stood stunned, amazed, and terrified, watching his
companion recede towards the marching glare. And
hardly had the shepherd set out when there came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
a noise like thunder, the beating of invisible wings
hurrying up the valley, and a great and terrible fear;
and at that the man who gave me the fruit turned&mdash;if
he might still escape. And hurrying headlong up
the slope again, with that tumult sweeping after him,
he stumbled against one of these stunted bushes,
and a ripe fruit came off it into his hand. This
fruit. Forthwith, the wings and the thunder rolled
all about him. He fell and fainted, and when he
came to his senses, he was back among the blackened
ruins of his own village, and I and the others were
attending to the wounded. A vision? But the
golden fruit of the tree was still clutched in his hand.
There were others there who knew the legend, knew
what that strange fruit might be.&rdquo; He paused.
&ldquo;And this is it,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>It was a most extraordinary story to be told in
a third-class carriage on a Sussex railway. It was
as if the real was a mere veil to the fantastic, and
here was the fantastic poking through. &ldquo;Is it?&rdquo;
was all Mr. Hinchcliff could say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The legend,&rdquo; said the stranger, &ldquo;tells that those
thickets of dwarfed trees growing about the garden
sprang from the apple that Adam carried in his
hand when he and Eve were driven forth. He felt
something in his hand, saw the half-eaten apple, and
flung it petulantly aside. And there they grow, in
that desolate valley, girdled round with the everlasting
snows, and there the fiery swords keep ward
against the Judgment Day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I thought these things were&rdquo;&mdash;Mr. Hinchcliff
paused&mdash;&ldquo;fables&mdash;parables rather. Do you
mean to tell me that there in Armenia&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>The stranger answered the unfinished question
with the fruit in his open hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Mr. Hinchcliff, &ldquo;that
that <em>is</em> the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge. The man
may have had&mdash;a sort of mirage, say. Suppose&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look at it,&rdquo; said the stranger.</p>

<p>It was certainly a strange-looking globe, not really
an apple, Mr. Hinchcliff saw, and a curious glowing
golden colour, almost as though light itself was
wrought into its substance. As he looked at it, he
began to see more vividly the desolate valley among
the mountains, the guarding swords of fire, the strange
antiquities of the story he had just heard. He rubbed
a knuckle into his eye. &ldquo;But&rdquo;&mdash;said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has kept like that, smooth and full, three
months. Longer than that it is now by some days.
No drying, no withering, no decay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you yourself,&rdquo; said Mr. Hinchcliff, &ldquo;really
believe that&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is the Forbidden Fruit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no mistaking the earnestness of the
man&rsquo;s manner and his perfect sanity. &ldquo;The Fruit
of Knowledge,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose it was?&rdquo; said Mr. Hinchcliff, after a
pause, still staring at it. &ldquo;But after all,&rdquo; said Mr.
Hinchcliff, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not my kind of knowledge&mdash;not the
sort of knowledge. I mean, Adam and Eve have
eaten it already.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We inherit their sins&mdash;not their knowledge,&rdquo;
said the stranger. &ldquo;That would make it all clear
and bright again. We should see into everything,
through everything, into the deepest meaning of
everything&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you eat it, then?&rdquo; said Mr. Hinchcliff,
with an inspiration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I took it intending to eat it,&rdquo; said the stranger.
&ldquo;Man has fallen. Merely to eat again could
scarcely&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Knowledge is power,&rdquo; said Mr. Hinchcliff.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But is it happiness? I am older than you&mdash;more
than twice as old. Time after time I
have held this in my hand, and my heart has failed
me at the thought of all that one might know,
that terrible lucidity&mdash; Suppose suddenly all the
world became pitilessly clear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That, I think, would be a great advantage,&rdquo; said
Mr. Hinchcliff, &ldquo;on the whole.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose you saw into the hearts and minds of
everyone about you, into their most secret recesses&mdash;people
you loved, whose love you valued?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d soon find out the humbugs,&rdquo; said Mr.
Hinchcliff, greatly struck by the idea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And worse&mdash;to know yourself, bare of your
most intimate illusions. To see yourself in your
place. All that your lusts and weaknesses prevented
your doing. No merciful perspective.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That might be an excellent thing too. &lsquo;Know
thyself,&rsquo; you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are young,&rdquo; said the stranger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t care to eat it, and it bothers you,
why don&rsquo;t you throw it away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There again, perhaps, you will not understand
me. To me, how could one throw away a thing
like that, glowing, wonderful? Once one has it, one
is bound. But, on the other hand, to <em>give</em> it away!
To give it away to someone who thirsted after knowledge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
who found no terror in the thought of that
clear perception&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Mr. Hinchcliff thoughtfully, &ldquo;it
might be some sort of poisonous fruit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then his eye caught something motionless,
the end of a white board black-lettered outside the
carriage window. &ldquo;&mdash;<span class="f8">MWOOD</span>,&rdquo; he saw. He started
convulsively. &ldquo;Gracious!&rdquo; said Mr. Hinchcliff.
&ldquo;Holmwood!&rdquo;&mdash;and the practical present blotted
out the mystic realisations that had been stealing
upon him.</p>

<p>In another moment he was opening the carriage-door,
portmanteau in hand. The guard was already
fluttering his green flag. Mr. Hinchcliff jumped out.
&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; said a voice behind him, and he saw the
dark eyes of the stranger shining and the golden
fruit, bright and bare, held out of the open carriage-door.
He took it instinctively, the train was already
moving.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>No!</em>&rdquo; shouted the stranger, and made a snatch
at it as if to take it back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stand away,&rdquo; cried a country porter, thrusting
forward to close the door. The stranger shouted
something Mr. Hinchcliff did not catch, head and
arm thrust excitedly out of the window, and then
the shadow of the bridge fell on him, and in a trice
he was hidden. Mr. Hinchcliff stood astonished,
staring at the end of the last waggon receding round
the bend, and with the wonderful fruit in his hand.
For the fraction of a minute his mind was confused,
and then he became aware that two or three people
on the platform were regarding him with interest.
Was he not the new Grammar School master making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
his début? It occurred to him that, so far as they
could tell, the fruit might very well be the naïve
refreshment of an orange. He flushed at the thought,
and thrust the fruit into his side pocket, where it
bulged undesirably. But there was no help for it,
so he went towards them, awkwardly concealing his
sense of awkwardness, to ask the way to the Grammar
School, and the means of getting his portmanteau
and the two tin boxes which lay up the platform
thither. Of all the odd and fantastic yarns to tell
a fellow!</p>

<p>His luggage could be taken on a truck for sixpence,
he found, and he could precede it on foot.
He fancied an ironical note in the voices. He was
painfully aware of his contour.</p>

<p>The curious earnestness of the man in the
train, and the glamour of the story he told, had,
for a time, diverted the current of Mr. Hinchcliff&rsquo;s
thoughts. It drove like a mist before his immediate
concerns. Fires that went to and fro! But
the preoccupation of his new position, and the
impression he was to produce upon Holmwood
generally, and the school people in particular, returned
upon him with reinvigorating power before
he left the station and cleared his mental atmosphere.
But it is extraordinary what an inconvenient thing
the addition of a soft and rather brightly-golden
fruit, not three inches in diameter, may prove to a
sensitive youth on his best appearance. In the
pocket of his black jacket it bulged dreadfully, spoilt
the lines altogether. He passed a little old lady in
black, and he felt her eye drop upon the excrescence
at once. He was wearing one glove and carrying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
the other, together with his stick, so that to bear the
fruit openly was impossible. In one place, where
the road into the town seemed suitably secluded,
he took his encumbrance out of his pocket and tried
it in his hat. It was just too large, the hat wobbled
ludicrously, and just as he was taking it out again, a
butcher&rsquo;s boy came driving round the corner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Confound it!&rdquo; said Mr. Hinchcliff.</p>

<p>He would have eaten the thing, and attained
omniscience there and then, but it would seem so
silly to go into the town sucking a juicy fruit&mdash;and
it certainly felt juicy. If one of the boys should come
by, it might do him a serious injury with his discipline
so to be seen. And the juice might make
his face sticky and get upon his cuffs&mdash;or it might
be an acid juice as potent as lemon, and take all
the colour out of his clothes.</p>

<p>Then round a bend in the lane came two pleasant
sunlit girlish figures. They were walking slowly
towards the town and chattering&mdash;at any moment
they might look round and see a hot-faced young
man behind them carrying a kind of phosphorescent
yellow tomato! They would be sure to laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Hang!</em>&rdquo; said Mr. Hinchcliff, and with a swift
jerk sent the encumbrance flying over the stone wall
of an orchard that there abutted on the road. As it
vanished, he felt a faint twinge of loss that lasted
scarcely a moment. He adjusted the stick and
glove in his hand, and walked on, erect and self-conscious,
to pass the girls.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>But in the darkness of the night Mr. Hinchcliff
had a dream, and saw the valley, and the flaming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
swords, and the contorted trees, and knew that it
really was the Apple of the Tree of Knowledge that
he had thrown regardlessly away. And he awoke
very unhappy.</p>

<p>In the morning his regret had passed, but afterwards
it returned and troubled him; never, however,
when he was happy or busily occupied. At last,
one moonlight night about eleven, when all Holmwood
was quiet, his regrets returned with redoubled
force, and therewith an impulse to adventure. He
slipped out of the house and over the playground
wall, went through the silent town to Station Lane,
and climbed into the orchard where he had thrown
the fruit. But nothing was to be found of it there
among the dewy grass and the faint intangible globes
of dandelion down.</p>

<h2><a name="UNDER_THE_KNIFE" id="UNDER_THE_KNIFE">UNDER THE KNIFE</a></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;What</span> if I die under it?&rdquo; The thought
recurred again and again, as I walked
home from Haddon&rsquo;s. It was a purely
personal question. I was spared the deep anxieties
of a married man, and I knew there were few of my
intimate friends but would find my death troublesome
chiefly on account of their duty of regret. I
was surprised indeed, and perhaps a little humiliated,
as I turned the matter over, to think how few
could possibly exceed the conventional requirement.
Things came before me stripped of glamour, in a
clear dry light, during that walk from Haddon&rsquo;s
house over Primrose Hill. There were the friends
of my youth: I perceived now that our affection
was a tradition, which we foregathered rather laboriously
to maintain. There were the rivals and
helpers of my later career: I suppose I had been
cold-blooded or undemonstrative&mdash;one perhaps implies
the other. It may be that even the capacity
for friendship is a question of physique. There had
been a time in my own life when I had grieved
bitterly enough at the loss of a friend; but as I
walked home that afternoon the emotional side of
my imagination was dormant. I could not pity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
myself, nor feel sorry for my friends, nor conceive of
them as grieving for me.</p>

<p>I was interested in this deadness of my emotional
nature&mdash;no doubt a concomitant of my stagnating
physiology; and my thoughts wandered off along
the line it suggested. Once before, in my hot
youth, I had suffered a sudden loss of blood, and
had been within an ace of death. I remembered
now that my affections as well as my passions had
drained out of me, leaving scarce anything but a
tranquil resignation, a dreg of self-pity. It had
been weeks before the old ambitions, and tendernesses,
and all the complex moral interplay of a man,
had reasserted themselves. It occurred to me that
the real meaning of this numbness might be a
gradual slipping away from the pleasure-pain guidance
of the animal man. It has been proven, I take
it, as thoroughly as anything can be proven in this
world, that the higher emotions, the moral feelings,
even the subtle tendernesses of love, are evolved
from the elemental desires and fears of the simple
animal: they are the harness in which man&rsquo;s mental
freedom goes. And it may be that, as death overshadows
us, as our possibility of acting diminishes,
this complex growth of balanced impulse, propensity,
and aversion, whose interplay inspires our acts, goes
with it. Leaving what?</p>

<p>I was suddenly brought back to reality by an
imminent collision with a butcher-boy&rsquo;s tray. I
found that I was crossing the bridge over the Regent&rsquo;s
Park Canal, which runs parallel with that in the
Zoological Gardens. The boy in blue had been
looking over his shoulder at a black barge advancing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
slowly, towed by a gaunt white horse. In the
Gardens a nurse was leading three happy little
children over the bridge. The trees were bright
green; the spring hopefulness was still unstained
by the dusts of summer; the sky in the water was
bright and clear, but broken by long waves, by
quivering bands of black, as the barge drove through.
The breeze was stirring; but it did not stir me as the
spring breeze used to do.</p>

<p>Was this dulness of feeling in itself an anticipation?
It was curious that I could reason and
follow out a network of suggestion as clearly as
ever: so, at least, it seemed to me. It was calmness
rather than dulness that was coming upon me.
Was there any ground for the belief in the presentiment
of death? Did a man near to death begin
instinctively to withdraw himself from the meshes of
matter and sense, even before the cold hand was
laid upon his? I felt strangely isolated&mdash;isolated
without regret&mdash;from the life and existence about
me. The children playing in the sun and gathering
strength and experience for the business of life, the
park-keeper gossiping with a nursemaid, the nursing
mother, the young couple intent upon each other as
they passed me, the trees by the wayside spreading
new pleading leaves to the sunlight, the stir in their
branches&mdash;I had been part of it all, but I had nearly
done with it now.</p>

<p>Some way down the Broad Walk I perceived that
I was tired, and that my feet were heavy. It was
hot that afternoon, and I turned aside and sat down
on one of the green chairs that line the way. In a
minute I had dozed into a dream, and the tide of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
my thoughts washed up a vision of the resurrection.
I was still sitting in the chair, but I thought myself
actually dead, withered, tattered, dried, one eye (I
saw) pecked out by birds. &ldquo;Awake!&rdquo; cried a voice;
and incontinently the dust of the path and the mould
under the grass became insurgent. I had never
before thought of Regent&rsquo;s Park as a cemetery, but
now, through the trees, stretching as far as eye could
see, I beheld a flat plain of writhing graves and
heeling tombstones. There seemed to be some
trouble: the rising dead appeared to stifle as they
struggled upward, they bled in their struggles, the
red flesh was tattered away from the white bones.
&ldquo;Awake!&rdquo; cried a voice; but I determined I would
not rise to such horrors. &ldquo;Awake!&rdquo; They would
not let me alone. &ldquo;Wike up!&rdquo; said an angry voice.
A cockney angel! The man who sells the tickets
was shaking me, demanding my penny.</p>

<p>I paid my penny, pocketed my ticket, yawned,
stretched my legs, and, feeling now rather less torpid,
got up and walked on towards Langham Place. I
speedily lost myself again in a shifting maze of
thoughts about death. Going across Marylebone
Road into that crescent at the end of Langham
Place, I had the narrowest escape from the shaft
of a cab, and went on my way with a palpitating
heart and a bruised shoulder. It struck me that
it would have been curious if my meditations on
my death on the morrow had led to my death
that day.</p>

<p>But I will not weary you with more of my experiences
that day and the next. I knew more and
more certainly that I should die under the operation;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
at times I think I was inclined to pose to myself.
The doctors were coming at eleven, and I did not
get up. It seemed scarce worth while to trouble
about washing and dressing, and though I read my
newspapers and the letters that came by the first post,
I did not find them very interesting. There was a
friendly note from Addison, my old school friend,
calling my attention to two discrepancies and a
printer&rsquo;s error in my new book, with one from
Langridge venting some vexation over Minton. The
rest were business communications. I breakfasted
in bed. The glow of pain at my side seemed more
massive. I knew it was pain, and yet, if you can
understand, I did not find it very painful. I had
been awake and hot and thirsty in the night, but in
the morning bed felt comfortable. In the night-time
I had lain thinking of things that were past;
in the morning I dozed over the question of immortality.
Haddon came, punctual to the minute,
with a neat black bag; and Mowbray soon followed.
Their arrival stirred me up a little. I began to take
a more personal interest in the proceedings. Haddon
moved the little octagonal table close to the bedside,
and, with his broad black back to me, began taking
things out of his bag. I heard the light click of
steel upon steel. My imagination, I found, was not
altogether stagnant. &ldquo;Will you hurt me much?&rdquo; I
said in an off-hand tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit,&rdquo; Haddon answered over his shoulder.
&ldquo;We shall chloroform you. Your heart&rsquo;s as sound
as a bell.&rdquo; And as he spoke, I had a whiff of the
pungent sweetness of the anæsthetic.</p>

<p>They stretched me out, with a convenient exposure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
of my side, and, almost before I realised what was
happening, the chloroform was being administered.
It stings the nostrils, and there is a suffocating sensation,
at first. I knew I should die&mdash;that this was
the end of consciousness for me. And suddenly I
felt that I was not prepared for death: I had a
vague sense of a duty overlooked&mdash;I knew not
what. What was it I had not done? I could
think of nothing more to do, nothing desirable left
in life; and yet I had the strangest disinclination
to death. And the physical sensation was painfully
oppressive. Of course the doctors did not know
they were going to kill me. Possibly I struggled.
Then I fell motionless, and a great silence, a monstrous
silence, and an impenetrable blackness came
upon me.</p>

<p>There must have been an interval of absolute
unconsciousness, seconds or minutes. Then, with
a chilly, unemotional clearness, I perceived that
I was not yet dead. I was still in my body; but
all the multitudinous sensations that come sweeping
from it to make up the background of consciousness
had gone, leaving me free of it all. No, not free of
it all; for as yet something still held me to the poor
stark flesh upon the bed&mdash;held me, yet not so closely
that I did not feel myself external to it, independent
of it, straining away from it. I do not think I saw,
I do not think I heard; but I perceived all that was
going on, and it was as if I both heard and saw.
Haddon was bending over me, Mowbray behind
me; the scalpel&mdash;it was a large scalpel&mdash;was cutting
my flesh at the side under the flying ribs. It
was interesting to see myself cut like cheese, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
a pang, without even a qualm. The interest was
much of a quality with that one might feel in a
game of chess between strangers. Haddon&rsquo;s face
was firm and his hand steady; but I was surprised
to perceive (<em>how</em> I know not) that he was feeling the
gravest doubt as to his own wisdom in the conduct
of the operation.</p>

<p>Mowbray&rsquo;s thoughts, too, I could see. He was
thinking that Haddon&rsquo;s manner showed too much
of the specialist. New suggestions came up like
bubbles through a stream of frothing meditation,
and burst one after another in the little bright spot
of his consciousness. He could not help noticing
and admiring Haddon&rsquo;s swift dexterity, in spite of
his envious quality and his disposition to detract.
I saw my liver exposed. I was puzzled at my own
condition. I did not feel that I was dead, but I
was different in some way from my living self. The
grey depression, that had weighed on me for a year
or more and coloured all my thoughts, was gone.
I perceived and thought without any emotional tint
at all. I wondered if everyone perceived things in
this way under chloroform, and forgot it again when
he came out of it. It would be inconvenient to look
into some heads, and not forget.</p>

<p>Although I did not think that I was dead, I still
perceived quite clearly that I was soon to die. This
brought me back to the consideration of Haddon&rsquo;s
proceedings. I looked into his mind, and saw that
he was afraid of cutting a branch of the portal vein.
My attention was distracted from details by the
curious changes going on in his mind. His consciousness
was like the quivering little spot of light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
which is thrown by the mirror of a galvanometer.
His thoughts ran under it like a stream, some
through the focus bright and distinct, some shadowy
in the half-light of the edge. Just now the little
glow was steady; but the least movement on Mowbray&rsquo;s
part, the slightest sound from outside, even a
faint difference in the slow movement of the living
flesh he was cutting, set the light-spot shivering and
spinning. A new sense-impression came rushing
up through the flow of thoughts; and lo! the light-spot
jerked away towards it, swifter than a frightened
fish. It was wonderful to think that upon that
unstable, fitful thing depended all the complex
motions of the man; that for the next five minutes,
therefore, my life hung upon its movements. And
he was growing more and more nervous in his
work. It was as if a little picture of a cut vein
grew brighter, and struggled to oust from his brain
another picture of a cut falling short of the mark.
He was afraid: his dread of cutting too little was
battling with his dread of cutting too far.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, like an escape of water from under
a lock-gate, a great uprush of horrible realisation
set all his thoughts swirling, and simultaneously I
perceived that the vein was cut. He started back
with a hoarse exclamation, and I saw the brown-purple
blood gather in a swift bead, and run trickling.
He was horrified. He pitched the red-stained
scalpel on to the octagonal table; and instantly
both doctors flung themselves upon me, making
hasty and ill-conceived efforts to remedy the disaster.
&ldquo;Ice!&rdquo; said Mowbray, gasping. But I knew that I
was killed, though my body still clung to me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>I will not describe their belated endeavours to
save me, though I perceived every detail. My
perceptions were sharper and swifter than they had
ever been in life; my thoughts rushed through my
mind with incredible swiftness, but with perfect definition.
I can only compare their crowded clarity
to the effects of a reasonable dose of opium. In a
moment it would all be over, and I should be free.
I knew I was immortal, but what would happen I
did not know. Should I drift off presently, like
a puff of smoke from a gun, in some kind of half-material
body, an attenuated version of my material
self? Should I find myself suddenly among the
innumerable hosts of the dead, and know the world
about me for the phantasmagoria it had always
seemed? Should I drift to some spiritualistic <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">séance</i>,
and there make foolish, incomprehensible attempts
to affect a purblind medium? It was a state of
unemotional curiosity, of colourless expectation. And
then I realised a growing stress upon me, a feeling
as though some huge human magnet was drawing
me upward out of my body. The stress grew and
grew. I seemed an atom for which monstrous
forces were fighting. For one brief, terrible moment
sensation came back to me. That feeling of falling
headlong which comes in nightmares, that feeling
a thousand times intensified, that and a black horror
swept across my thoughts in a torrent. Then the
two doctors, the naked body with its cut side, the
little room, swept away from under me and vanished,
as a speck of foam vanishes down an eddy.</p>

<p>I was in mid-air. Far below was the West End
of London, receding rapidly,&mdash;for I seemed to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
flying swiftly upward,&mdash;and, as it receded, passing
westward, like a panorama. I could see, through
the faint haze of smoke, the innumerable roofs
chimney-set, the narrow roadways, stippled with
people and conveyances, the little specks of squares,
and the church steeples like thorns sticking out of
the fabric. But it spun away as the earth rotated
on its axis, and in a few seconds (as it seemed) I
was over the scattered clumps of town about Ealing,
the little Thames a thread of blue to the south, and
the Chiltern Hills and the North Downs coming
up like the rim of a basin, far away and faint
with haze. Up I rushed. And at first I had not
the faintest conception what this headlong rush
upward could mean.</p>

<p>Every moment the circle of scenery beneath me
grew wider and wider, and the details of town and
field, of hill and valley, got more and more hazy
and pale and indistinct, a luminous grey was mingled
more and more with the blue of the hills and the
green of the open meadows; and a little patch of
cloud, low and far to the west, shone ever more
dazzlingly white. Above, as the veil of atmosphere
between myself and outer space grew thinner, the
sky, which had been a fair springtime blue at first,
grew deeper and richer in colour, passing steadily
through the intervening shades, until presently it
was as dark as the blue sky of midnight, and
presently as black as the blackness of a frosty starlight,
and at last as black as no blackness I had
ever beheld. And first one star, and then many,
and at last an innumerable host broke out upon the
sky: more stars than anyone has ever seen from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
the face of the earth. For the blueness of the sky
is the light of the sun and stars sifted and spread
abroad blindingly: there is diffused light even in
the darkest skies of winter, and we do not see the
stars by day only because of the dazzling irradiation
of the sun. But now I saw things&mdash;I know not
how; assuredly with no mortal eyes&mdash;and that
defect of bedazzlement blinded me no longer. The
sun was incredibly strange and wonderful. The
body of it was a disc of blinding white light: not
yellowish, as it seems to those who live upon the
earth, but livid white, all streaked with scarlet streaks
and rimmed about with a fringe of writhing tongues
of red fire. And, shooting half-way across the
heavens from either side of it, and brighter than the
Milky Way, were two pinions of silver-white, making
it look more like those winged globes I have seen
in Egyptian sculpture, than anything else I can
remember upon earth. These I knew for the solar
corona, though I had never seen anything of it but
a picture during the days of my earthly life.</p>

<p>When my attention came back to the earth again,
I saw that it had fallen very far away from me.
Field and town were long since indistinguishable,
and all the varied hues of the country were merging
into a uniform bright grey, broken only by the
brilliant white of the clouds that lay scattered in
flocculent masses over Ireland and the west of
England. For now I could see the outlines of the
north of France and Ireland, and all this island of
Britain, save where Scotland passed over the horizon
to the north, or where the coast was blurred or
obliterated by cloud. The sea was a dull grey, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
darker than the land; and the whole panorama was
rotating slowly towards the east.</p>

<p>All this had happened so swiftly that, until I was
some thousand miles or so from the earth, I had no
thought for myself. But now I perceived I had
neither hands nor feet, neither parts nor organs, and
that I felt neither alarm nor pain. All about me I
perceived that the vacancy (for I had already left
the air behind) was cold beyond the imagination of
man; but it troubled me not. The sun&rsquo;s rays shot
through the void, powerless to light or heat until
they should strike on matter in their course. I saw
things with a serene self-forgetfulness, even as if I
were God. And down below there, rushing away
from me,&mdash;countless miles in a second,&mdash;where a
little dark spot on the grey marked the position of
London, two doctors were struggling to restore life
to the poor hacked and outworn shell I had abandoned.
I felt then such release, such serenity as
I can compare to no mortal delight I have ever
known.</p>

<p>It was only after I had perceived all these things
that the meaning of that headlong rush of the earth
grew into comprehension. Yet it was so simple,
so obvious, that I was amazed at my never anticipating
the thing that was happening to me. I had
suddenly been cut adrift from matter: all that was
material of me was there upon earth, whirling away
through space, held to the earth by gravitation, partaking
of the earth-inertia, moving in its wreath of
epicycles round the sun, and with the sun and the
planets on their vast march through space. But
the immaterial has no inertia, feels nothing of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
pull of matter for matter: where it parts from its
garment of flesh, there it remains (so far as space
concerns it any longer) immovable in space. I was
not leaving the earth: the earth was leaving <em>me</em>,
and not only the earth, but the whole solar system
was streaming past. And about me in space,
invisible to me, scattered in the wake of the earth
upon its journey, there must be an innumerable
multitude of souls, stripped like myself of the
material, stripped like myself of the passions of
the individual and the generous emotions of the
gregarious brute, naked intelligences, things of newborn
wonder and thought, marvelling at the strange
release that had suddenly come on them!</p>

<p>As I receded faster and faster from the strange
white sun in the black heavens, and from the broad
and shining earth upon which my being had begun,
I seemed to grow, in some incredible manner, vast:
vast as regards this world I had left, vast as regards
the moments and periods of a human life. Very
soon I saw the full circle of the earth, slightly
gibbous, like the moon when she nears her full, but
very large; and the silvery shape of America was
now in the noonday blaze wherein (as it seemed)
little England had been basking but a few minutes
ago. At first the earth was large, and shone in the
heavens, filling a great part of them; but every
moment she grew smaller and more distant. As
she shrunk, the broad moon in its third quarter
crept into view over the rim of her disc. I looked
for the constellations. Only that part of Aries
directly behind the sun and the Lion, which the
earth covered, were hidden. I recognised the tortuous,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
tattered band of the Milky Way, with Vega
very bright between sun and earth; and Sirius
and Orion shone splendid against the unfathomable
blackness in the opposite quarter of the heavens.
The Pole Star was overhead, and the Great Bear
hung over the circle of the earth. And away
beneath and beyond the shining corona of the sun
were strange groupings of stars I had never seen in
my life&mdash;notably, a dagger-shaped group that I
knew for the Southern Cross. All these were no
larger than when they had shone on earth; but the
little stars that one scarce sees shone now against the
setting of black vacancy as brightly as the first-magnitudes
had done, while the larger worlds were
points of indescribable glory and colour. Aldebaran
was a spot of blood-red fire, and Sirius
condensed to one point the light of a world of
sapphires. And they shone steadily: they did not
scintillate, they were calmly glorious. My impressions
had an adamantine hardness and brightness:
there was no blurring softness, no atmosphere,
nothing but infinite darkness set with the myriads
of these acute and brilliant points and specks of
light. Presently, when I looked again, the little
earth seemed no bigger than the sun, and it
dwindled and turned as I looked, until, in a second&rsquo;s
space (as it seemed to me), it was halved; and so
it went on swiftly dwindling. Far away in the
opposite direction, a little pinkish pin&rsquo;s head of light,
shining steadily, was the planet Mars. I swam
motionless in vacancy, and, without a trace of terror
or astonishment, watched the speck of cosmic dust
we call the world fall away from me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>Presently it dawned upon me that my sense of
duration had changed: that my mind was moving
not faster but infinitely slower, that between each
separate impression there was a period of many days.
The moon spun once round the earth as I noted
this; and I perceived clearly the motion of Mars
in his orbit. Moreover, it appeared as if the time
between thought and thought grew steadily greater,
until at last a thousand years was but a moment in
my perception.</p>

<p>At first the constellations had shone motionless
against the black background of infinite space; but
presently it seemed as though the group of stars
about Hercules and the Scorpion was contracting,
while Orion and Aldebaran and their neighbours
were scattering apart. Flashing suddenly out of
the darkness there came a flying multitude of particles
of rock, glittering like dust-specks in a sunbeam,
and encompassed in a faintly luminous haze.
They swirled all about me, and vanished again in a
twinkling far behind. And then I saw that a bright
spot of light, that shone a little to one side of my
path, was growing very rapidly larger, and perceived
that it was the planet Saturn rushing towards me.
Larger and larger it grew, swallowing up the
heavens behind it, and hiding every moment a fresh
multitude of stars. I perceived its flattened, whirling
body, its disc-like belt, and seven of its little
satellites. It grew and grew, till it towered enormous;
and then I plunged amid a streaming multitude
of clashing stones and dancing dust-particles
and gas-eddies, and saw for a moment the mighty
triple belt like three concentric arches of moonlight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
above me, its shadow black on the boiling tumult
below. These things happened in one-tenth of the
time it takes to tell of them. The planet went by
like a flash of lightning; for a few seconds it blotted
out the sun, and there and then became a mere black,
dwindling, winged patch against the light. The
earth, the mother mote of my being, I could no
longer see.</p>

<p>So, with a stately swiftness, in the profoundest
silence, the solar system fell from me, as it had
been a garment, until the sun was a mere star amid
the multitude of stars, with its eddy of planet-specks,
lost in the confused glittering of the remoter light.
I was no longer a denizen of the solar system: I
had come to the Outer Universe, I seemed to grasp
and comprehend the whole world of matter. Ever
more swiftly the stars closed in about the spot where
Antares and Vega had vanished in a luminous haze,
until that part of the sky had the semblance of a
whirling mass of nebulæ, and ever before me yawned
vaster gaps of vacant blackness, and the stars shone
fewer and fewer. It seemed as if I moved towards a
point between Orion&rsquo;s belt and sword; and the void
about that region opened vaster and vaster every
second, an incredible gulf of nothingness, into which
I was falling. Faster and ever faster the universe
rushed by, a hurry of whirling motes at last, speeding
silently into the void. Stars glowing brighter and
brighter, with their circling planets catching the light
in a ghostly fashion as I neared them, shone out and
vanished again into inexistence; faint comets, clusters
of meteorites, winking specks of matter, eddying light
points, whizzed past, some perhaps a hundred millions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
of miles or so from me at most, few nearer, travelling
with unimaginable rapidity, shooting constellations,
momentary darts of fire, through that black, enormous
night. More than anything else it was like a
dusty draught, sunbeam-lit. Broader, and wider,
and deeper grew the starless space, the vacant
Beyond, into which I was being drawn. At last a
quarter of the heavens was black and blank, and
the whole headlong rush of stellar universe closed
in behind me like a veil of light that is gathered
together. It drove away from me like a monstrous
jack-o&rsquo;-lantern driven by the wind. I had come out
into the wilderness of space. Ever the vacant blackness
grew broader, until the hosts of the stars seemed
only like a swarm of fiery specks hurrying away from
me, inconceivably remote, and the darkness, the
nothingness and emptiness, was about me on every
side. Soon the little universe of matter, the cage
of points in which I had begun to be, was dwindling,
now to a whirling disc of luminous glittering, and
now to one minute disc of hazy light. In a little
while it would shrink to a point, and at last would
vanish altogether.</p>

<p>Suddenly feeling came back to me&mdash;feeling in
the shape of overwhelming terror: such a dread of
those dark vastitudes as no words can describe, a
passionate resurgence of sympathy and social desire.
Were there other souls, invisible to me as I to them,
about me in the blackness? or was I indeed, even
as I felt, alone? Had I passed out of being into
something that was neither being nor not-being?
The covering of the body, the covering of matter,
had been torn from me, and the hallucinations of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
companionship and security. Everything was black
and silent. I had ceased to be. I was nothing.
There was nothing, save only that infinitesimal dot of
light that dwindled in the gulf. I strained myself to
hear and see, and for a while there was naught but infinite
silence, intolerable darkness, horror, and despair.</p>

<p>Then I saw that about the spot of light into
which the whole world of matter had shrunk there
was a faint glow. And in a band on either side of
that the darkness was not absolute. I watched it
for ages, as it seemed to me, and through the long
waiting the haze grew imperceptibly more distinct.
And then about the band appeared an irregular
cloud of the faintest, palest brown. I felt a passionate
impatience; but the things grew brighter so
slowly that they scarce seemed to change. What
was unfolding itself? What was this strange reddish
dawn in the interminable night of space?</p>

<p>The cloud&rsquo;s shape was grotesque. It seemed to
be looped along its lower side into four projecting
masses, and, above, it ended in a straight line.
What phantom was it? I felt assured I had seen
that figure before; but I could not think what, nor
where, nor when it was. Then the realisation rushed
upon me. <em>It was a clenched Hand.</em> I was alone in
space, alone with this huge, shadowy Hand, upon
which the whole Universe of Matter lay like an
unconsidered speck of dust. It seemed as though
I watched it through vast periods of time. On the
forefinger glittered a ring; and the universe from
which I had come was but a spot of light upon the
ring&rsquo;s curvature. And the thing that the hand
gripped had the likeness of a black rod. Through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
a long eternity I watched this Hand, with the ring
and the rod, marvelling and fearing and waiting
helplessly on what might follow. It seemed as
though nothing could follow: that I should watch
for ever, seeing only the Hand and the thing it
held, and understanding nothing of its import. Was
the whole universe but a refracting speck upon some
greater Being? Were our worlds but the atoms of
another universe, and those again of another, and so
on through an endless progression? And what was
I? Was I indeed immaterial? A vague persuasion
of a body gathering about me came into my suspense.
The abysmal darkness about the Hand
filled with impalpable suggestions, with uncertain,
fluctuating shapes.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, came a sound, like the sound of
a tolling bell: faint, as if infinitely far; muffled, as
though heard through thick swathings of darkness:
a deep, vibrating resonance, with vast gulfs of silence
between each stroke. And the Hand appeared to
tighten on the rod. And I saw far above the
Hand, towards the apex of the darkness, a circle of
dim phosphorescence, a ghostly sphere whence these
sounds came throbbing; and at the last stroke the
Hand vanished, for the hour had come, and I heard
a noise of many waters. But the black rod remained
as a great band across the sky. And then a voice,
which seemed to run to the uttermost parts of space,
spoke, saying, &ldquo;There will be no more pain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that an almost intolerable gladness and radiance
rushed in upon me, and I saw the circle shining
white and bright, and the rod black and shining,
and many things else distinct and clear. And the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
circle was the face of the clock, and the rod the rail
of my bed. Haddon was standing at the foot,
against the rail, with a small pair of scissors on his
fingers; and the hands of my clock on the mantel
over his shoulder were clasped together over the
hour of twelve. Mowbray was washing something
in a basin at the octagonal table, and at my side I
felt a subdued feeling that could scarce be spoken of
as pain.</p>

<p>The operation had not killed me. And I perceived,
suddenly, that the dull melancholy of half a
year was lifted from my mind.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Until</span> the extraordinary affair at Sidmouth,
the peculiar species <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Haploteuthis ferox</i> was
known to science only generically, on the
strength of a half-digested tentacle obtained near the
Azores, and a decaying body pecked by birds and
nibbled by fish, found early in 1896 by Mr. Jennings,
near Land&rsquo;s End.</p>

<p>In no department of zoological science, indeed,
are we quite so much in the dark as with regard to the
deep-sea cephalopods. A mere accident, for instance,
it was that led to the Prince of Monaco&rsquo;s discovery
of nearly a dozen new forms in the summer of 1895,
a discovery in which the before-mentioned tentacle
was included. It chanced that a cachalot was killed
off Terceira by some sperm whalers, and in its last
struggles charged almost to the Prince&rsquo;s yacht, missed
it, rolled under, and died within twenty yards of his
rudder. And in its agony it threw up a number of
large objects, which the Prince, dimly perceiving they
were strange and important, was, by a happy expedient,
able to secure before they sank. He set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
his screws in motion, and kept them circling in the
vortices thus created until a boat could be lowered.
And these specimens were whole cephalopods and
fragments of cephalopods, some of gigantic proportions,
and almost all of them unknown to science!</p>

<p>It would seem, indeed, that these large and agile
creatures, living in the middle depths of the sea,
must, to a large extent, for ever remain unknown to
us, since under water they are too nimble for nets,
and it is only by such rare unlooked-for accidents
that specimens can be obtained. In the case of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Haploteuthis ferox</i>, for instance, we are still altogether
ignorant of its habitat, as ignorant as we are
of the breeding-ground of the herring or the sea-ways
of the salmon. And zoologists are altogether at a
loss to account for its sudden appearance on our
coast. Possibly it was the stress of a hunger
migration that drove it hither out of the deep. But
it will be, perhaps, better to avoid necessarily inconclusive
discussion, and to proceed at once with our
narrative.</p>

<p>The first human being to set eyes upon a living
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Haploteuthis</i>&mdash;the first human being to survive, that
is, for there can be little doubt now that the wave of
bathing fatalities and boating accidents that travelled
along the coast of Cornwall and Devon in early May
was due to this cause&mdash;was a retired tea-dealer of
the name of Fison, who was stopping at a Sidmouth
boarding-house. It was in the afternoon, and he
was walking along the cliff path between Sidmouth
and Ladram Bay. The cliffs in this direction are
very high, but down the red face of them in one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
place a kind of ladder staircase has been made. He
was near this when his attention was attracted by
what at first he thought to be a cluster of birds
struggling over a fragment of food that caught the
sunlight, and glistened pinkish-white. The tide was
right out, and this object was not only far below him,
but remote across a broad waste of rock reefs covered
with dark seaweed and interspersed with silvery
shining tidal pools. And he was, moreover, dazzled
by the brightness of the further water.</p>

<p>In a minute, regarding this again, he perceived
that his judgment was in fault, for over this struggle
circled a number of birds, jackdaws and gulls for the
most part, the latter gleaming blindingly when the
sunlight smote their wings, and they seemed minute
in comparison with it. And his curiosity was,
perhaps, aroused all the more strongly because of
his first insufficient explanations.</p>

<p>As he had nothing better to do than amuse
himself, he decided to make this object, whatever it
was, the goal of his afternoon walk, instead of Ladram
Bay, conceiving it might perhaps be a great fish of
some sort, stranded by some chance, and flapping
about in its distress. And so he hurried down the
long steep ladder, stopping at intervals of thirty feet
or so to take breath and scan the mysterious
movement.</p>

<p>At the foot of the cliff he was, of course, nearer
his object than he had been; but, on the other hand,
it now came up against the incandescent sky, beneath
the sun, so as to seem dark and indistinct. Whatever
was pinkish of it was now hidden by a skerry of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
weedy boulders. But he perceived that it was made
up of seven rounded bodies, distinct or connected,
and that the birds kept up a constant croaking and
screaming, but seemed afraid to approach it too
closely.</p>

<p>Mr. Fison, torn by curiosity, began picking his
way across the wave-worn rocks, and, finding the
wet seaweed that covered them thickly rendered
them extremely slippery, he stopped, removed his
shoes and socks, and coiled his trousers above his
knees. His object was, of course, merely to avoid
stumbling into the rocky pools about him, and
perhaps he was rather glad, as all men are, of an
excuse to resume, even for a moment, the sensations
of his boyhood. At anyrate, it is to this, no doubt,
that he owes his life.</p>

<p>He approached his mark with all the assurance
which the absolute security of this country against
all forms of animal life gives its inhabitants. The
round bodies moved to and fro, but it was only
when he surmounted the skerry of boulders I have
mentioned that he realised the horrible nature
of the discovery. It came upon him with some
suddenness.</p>

<p>The rounded bodies fell apart as he came into
sight over the ridge, and displayed the pinkish object
to be the partially devoured body of a human being,
but whether of a man or woman he was unable to
say. And the rounded bodies were new and ghastly-looking
creatures, in shape somewhat resembling an
octopus, and with huge and very long and flexible
tentacles, coiled copiously on the ground. The skin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
had a glistening texture, unpleasant to see, like shiny
leather. The downward bend of the tentacle-surrounded
mouth, the curious excrescence at the
bend, the tentacles, and the large intelligent eyes,
gave the creatures a grotesque suggestion of a face.
They were the size of a fair-sized swine about the
body, and the tentacles seemed to him to be many
feet in length. There were, he thinks, seven or eight
at least of the creatures. Twenty yards beyond
them, amid the surf of the now returning tide, two
others were emerging from the sea.</p>

<p>Their bodies lay flatly on the rocks, and their eyes
regarded him with evil interest; but it does not
appear that Mr. Fison was afraid, or that he realised
that he was in any danger. Possibly his confidence
is to be ascribed to the limpness of their attitudes.
But he was horrified, of course, and intensely excited
and indignant at such revolting creatures preying
upon human flesh. He thought they had chanced
upon a drowned body. He shouted to them, with
the idea of driving them off, and, finding they did
not budge, cast about him, picked up a big rounded
lump of rock, and flung it at one.</p>

<p>And then, slowly uncoiling their tentacles, they
all began moving towards him&mdash;creeping at first
deliberately, and making a soft purring sound to
each other.</p>

<p>In a moment Mr. Fison realised that he was in
danger. He shouted again, threw both his boots,
and started off, with a leap, forthwith. Twenty
yards off he stopped and faced about, judging them
slow, and behold! the tentacles of their leader were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
already pouring over the rocky ridge on which he
had just been standing!</p>

<p>At that he shouted again, but this time not
threatening, but a cry of dismay, and began jumping,
striding, slipping, wading across the uneven
expanse between him and the beach. The tall red
cliffs seemed suddenly at a vast distance, and he
saw, as though they were creatures in another world,
two minute workmen engaged in the repair of the
ladder-way, and little suspecting the race for life
that was beginning below them. At one time he
could hear the creatures splashing in the pools not
a dozen feet behind him, and once he slipped and
almost fell.</p>

<p>They chased him to the very foot of the cliffs,
and desisted only when he had been joined by the
workmen at the foot of the ladder-way up the cliff.
All three of the men pelted them with stones for a
time, and then hurried to the cliff top and along the
path towards Sidmouth, to secure assistance and a
boat, and to rescue the desecrated body from the
clutches of these abominable creatures.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>And, as if he had not already been in sufficient
peril that day, Mr. Fison went with the boat to
point out the exact spot of his adventure.</p>

<p>As the tide was down, it required a considerable
detour to reach the spot, and when at last they
came off the ladder-way, the mangled body had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
disappeared. The water was now running in, submerging
first one slab of slimy rock and then
another, and the four men in the boat&mdash;the workmen,
that is, the boatman, and Mr. Fison&mdash;now
turned their attention from the bearings off shore
to the water beneath the keel.</p>

<p>At first they could see little below them, save a
dark jungle of laminaria, with an occasional darting
fish. Their minds were set on adventure, and they
expressed their disappointment freely. But presently
they saw one of the monsters swimming
through the water seaward, with a curious rolling
motion that suggested to Mr. Fison the spinning
roll of a captive balloon. Almost immediately after,
the waving streamers of laminaria were extraordinarily
perturbed, parted for a moment, and three of
these beasts became darkly visible, struggling for
what was probably some fragment of the drowned
man. In a moment the copious olive-green ribbons
had poured again over this writhing group.</p>

<p>At that all four men, greatly excited, began beating
the water with oars and shouting, and immediately
they saw a tumultuous movement among
the weeds. They desisted to see more clearly, and
as soon as the water was smooth, they saw, as it
seemed to them, the whole sea bottom among the
weeds set with eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ugly swine!&rdquo; cried one of the men. &ldquo;Why,
there&rsquo;s dozens!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And forthwith the things began to rise through
the water about them. Mr. Fison has since described
to the writer this startling eruption out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
the waving laminaria meadows. To him it seemed
to occupy a considerable time, but it is probable that
really it was an affair of a few seconds only. For
a time nothing but eyes, and then he speaks of
tentacles streaming out and parting the weed fronds
this way and that. Then these things, growing
larger, until at last the bottom was hidden by their
intercoiling forms, and the tips of tentacles rose
darkly here and there into the air above the swell
of the waters.</p>

<p>One came up boldly to the side of the boat, and,
clinging to this with three of its sucker-set tentacles,
threw four others over the gunwale, as if with an
intention either of oversetting the boat or of
clambering into it. Mr. Fison at once caught up
the boathook, and, jabbing furiously at the soft tentacles,
forced it to desist. He was struck in the
back and almost pitched overboard by the boatman,
who was using his oar to resist a similar attack on
the other side of the boat. But the tentacles on
either side at once relaxed their hold at this, slid
out of sight, and splashed into the water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better get out of this,&rdquo; said Mr. Fison, who
was trembling violently. He went to the tiller,
while the boatman and one of the workmen seated
themselves and began rowing. The other workman
stood up in the fore part of the boat, with the boathook,
ready to strike any more tentacles that might
appear. Nothing else seems to have been said.
Mr. Fison had expressed the common feeling beyond
amendment. In a hushed, scared mood, with faces
white and drawn, they set about escaping from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
the position into which they had so recklessly
blundered.</p>

<p>But the oars had scarcely dropped into the water
before dark, tapering, serpentine ropes had bound
them, and were about the rudder; and creeping up
the sides of the boat with a looping motion came
the suckers again. The men gripped their oars and
pulled, but it was like trying to move a boat in a
floating raft of weeds. &ldquo;Help here!&rdquo; cried the
boatman, and Mr. Fison and the second workman
rushed to help lug at the oar.</p>

<p>Then the man with the boathook&mdash;his name was
Ewan, or Ewen&mdash;sprang up with a curse, and began
striking downward over the side, as far as he could
reach, at the bank of tentacles that now clustered
along the boat&rsquo;s bottom. And, at the same time,
the two rowers stood up to get a better purchase for
the recovery of their oars. The boatman handed his
to Mr. Fison, who lugged desperately, and, meanwhile,
the boatman opened a big clasp-knife, and,
leaning over the side of the boat, began hacking at
the spiring arms upon the oar shaft.</p>

<p>Mr. Fison, staggering with the quivering rocking
of the boat, his teeth set, his breath coming short,
and the veins starting on his hands as he pulled at
his oar, suddenly cast his eyes seaward. And there,
not fifty yards off, across the long rollers of the
incoming tide, was a large boat standing in towards
them, with three women and a little child in it. A
boatman was rowing, and a little man in a pink-ribboned
straw hat and whites stood in the stern,
hailing them. For a moment, of course, Mr. Fison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
thought of help, and then he thought of the child.
He abandoned his oar forthwith, threw up his arms
in a frantic gesture, and screamed to the party in
the boat to keep away &ldquo;for God&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo; It says
much for the modesty and courage of Mr. Fison that
he does not seem to be aware that there was any
quality of heroism in his action at this juncture. The
oar he had abandoned was at once drawn under,
and presently reappeared floating about twenty yards
away.</p>

<p>At the same moment Mr. Fison felt the boat
under him lurch violently, and a hoarse scream, a
prolonged cry of terror from Hill, the boatman,
caused him to forget the party of excursionists altogether.
He turned, and saw Hill crouching by the
forward rowlock, his face convulsed with terror, and
his right arm over the side and drawn tightly down.
He gave now a succession of short, sharp cries, &ldquo;Oh!
oh! oh!&mdash;oh!&rdquo; Mr. Fison believes that he must
have been hacking at the tentacles below the water-line,
and have been grasped by them, but, of course,
it is quite impossible to say now certainly what had
happened. The boat was heeling over, so that the
gunwale was within ten inches of the water, and
both Ewan and the other labourer were striking
down into the water, with oar and boathook, on
either side of Hill&rsquo;s arm. Mr. Fison instinctively
placed himself to counterpoise them.</p>

<p>Then Hill, who was a burly, powerful man, made
a strenuous effort, and rose almost to a standing
position. He lifted his arm, indeed, clean out of the
water. Hanging to it was a complicated tangle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
brown ropes; and the eyes of one of the brutes that
had hold of him, glaring straight and resolute, showed
momentarily above the surface. The boat heeled
more and more, and the green-brown water came
pouring in a cascade over the side. Then Hill
slipped and fell with his ribs across the side, and
his arm and the mass of tentacles about it splashed
back into the water. He rolled over; his boot
kicked Mr. Fison&rsquo;s knee as that gentleman rushed
forward to seize him, and in another moment fresh
tentacles had whipped about his waist and neck,
and after a brief, convulsive struggle, in which the
boat was nearly capsized, Hill was lugged overboard.
The boat righted with a violent jerk that all but
sent Mr. Fison over the other side, and hid the
struggle in the water from his eyes.</p>

<p>He stood staggering to recover his balance for a
moment, and as he did so, he became aware that
the struggle and the inflowing tide had carried them
close upon the weedy rocks again. Not four yards
off a table of rock still rose in rhythmic movements
above the in-wash of the tide. In a moment Mr.
Fison seized the oar from Ewan, gave one vigorous
stroke, then, dropping it, ran to the bows and leapt.
He felt his feet slide over the rock, and, by a frantic
effort, leapt again towards a further mass. He
stumbled over this, came to his knees, and rose
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look out!&rdquo; cried someone, and a large drab
body struck him. He was knocked flat into a tidal
pool by one of the workmen, and as he went down
he heard smothered, choking cries, that he believed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
at the time came from Hill. Then he found himself
marvelling at the shrillness and variety of Hill&rsquo;s
voice. Someone jumped over him, and a curving rush
of foamy water poured over him, and passed. He
scrambled to his feet dripping, and, without looking
seaward, ran as fast as his terror would let him
shoreward. Before him, over the flat space of
scattered rocks, stumbled the two workmen&mdash;one a
dozen yards in front of the other.</p>

<p>He looked over his shoulder at last, and, seeing
that he was not pursued, faced about. He was
astonished. From the moment of the rising of the
cephalopods out of the water, he had been acting
too swiftly to fully comprehend his actions. Now
it seemed to him as if he had suddenly jumped out
of an evil dream.</p>

<p>For there were the sky, cloudless and blazing
with the afternoon sun, the sea weltering under its
pitiless brightness, the soft creamy foam of the
breaking water, and the low, long, dark ridges of
rock. The righted boat floated, rising and falling
gently on the swell about a dozen yards from shore.
Hill and the monsters, all the stress and tumult of
that fierce fight for life, had vanished as though
they had never been.</p>

<p>Mr. Fison&rsquo;s heart was beating violently; he was
throbbing to the finger-tips, and his breath came deep.</p>

<p>There was something missing. For some seconds
he could not think clearly enough what this might
be. Sun, sky, sea, rocks&mdash;what was it? Then he
remembered the boatload of excursionists. It had
vanished. He wondered whether he had imagined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
it. He turned, and saw the two workmen standing
side by side under the projecting masses of the tall
pink cliffs. He hesitated whether he should make
one last attempt to save the man Hill. His physical
excitement seemed to desert him suddenly, and leave
him aimless and helpless. He turned shoreward,
stumbling and wading towards his two companions.</p>

<p>He looked back again, and there were now two
boats floating, and the one farthest out at sea
pitched clumsily, bottom upward.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>So it was <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Haploteuthis ferox</i> made its appearance
upon the Devonshire coast. So far, this has been
its most serious aggression. Mr. Fison&rsquo;s account,
taken together with the wave of boating and bathing
casualties to which I have already alluded, and the
absence of fish from the Cornish coasts that year,
points clearly to a shoal of these voracious deep-sea
monsters prowling slowly along the sub-tidal coastline.
Hunger migration has, I know, been suggested
as the force that drove them hither; but, for my own
part, I prefer to believe the alternative theory of
Hemsley. Hemsley holds that a pack or shoal of
these creatures may have become enamoured of
human flesh by the accident of a foundered ship
sinking among them, and have wandered in search
of it out of their accustomed zone; first waylaying
and following ships, and so coming to our shores in
the wake of the Atlantic traffic. But to discuss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
Hemsley&rsquo;s cogent and admirably-stated arguments
would be out of place here.</p>

<p>It would seem that the appetites of the shoal were
satisfied by the catch of eleven people&mdash;for so far as
can be ascertained, there were ten people in the
second boat, and certainly these creatures gave no
further signs of their presence off Sidmouth that day.
The coast between Seaton and Budleigh Salterton
was patrolled all that evening and night by four
Preventive Service boats, the men in which were
armed with harpoons and cutlasses, and as the
evening advanced, a number of more or less similarly
equipped expeditions, organised by private individuals,
joined them. Mr. Fison took no part in
any of these expeditions.</p>

<p>About midnight excited hails were heard from a
boat about a couple of miles out at sea to the south-east
of Sidmouth, and a lantern was seen waving in
a strange manner to and fro and up and down. The
nearer boats at once hurried towards the alarm. The
venturesome occupants of the boat, a seaman, a
curate, and two schoolboys, had actually seen the
monsters passing under their boat. The creatures,
it seems, like most deep-sea organisms, were phosphorescent,
and they had been floating, five fathoms
deep or so, like creatures of moonshine through the
blackness of the water, their tentacles retracted and
as if asleep, rolling over and over, and moving slowly
in a wedge-like formation towards the south-east.</p>

<p>These people told their story in gesticulated fragments,
as first one boat drew alongside and then
another. At last there was a little fleet of eight or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
nine boats collected together, and from them a
tumult, like the chatter of a marketplace, rose into
the stillness of the night. There was little or no
disposition to pursue the shoal, the people had
neither weapons nor experience for such a dubious
chase, and presently&mdash;even with a certain relief, it
may be&mdash;the boats turned shoreward.</p>

<p>And now to tell what is perhaps the most astonishing
fact in this whole astonishing raid. We have
not the slightest knowledge of the subsequent movements
of the shoal, although the whole south-west
coast was now alert for it. But it may, perhaps, be
significant that a cachalot was stranded off Sark on
June 3. Two weeks and three days after this
Sidmouth affair, a living <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Haploteuthis</i> came ashore
on Calais sands. It was alive, because several
witnesses saw its tentacles moving in a convulsive
way. But it is probable that it was dying. A gentleman
named Pouchet obtained a rifle and shot it.</p>

<p>That was the last appearance of a living <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Haploteuthis</i>.
No others were seen on the French coast.
On the 15th of June a dead body, almost complete,
was washed ashore near Torquay, and a few days
later a boat from the Marine Biological station,
engaged in dredging off Plymouth, picked up a
rotting specimen, slashed deeply with a cutlass
wound. How the former specimen had come by its
death it is impossible to say. And on the last day
of June, Mr. Egbert Caine, an artist, bathing near
Newlyn, threw up his arms, shrieked, and was drawn
under. A friend bathing with him made no attempt
to save him, but swam at once for the shore. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
is the last fact to tell of this extraordinary raid from
the deeper sea. Whether it is really the last of these
horrible creatures it is, as yet, premature to say.
But it is believed, and certainly it is to be hoped,
that they have returned now, and returned for good,
to the sunless depths of the middle seas, out of
which they have so strangely and so mysteriously
arisen.</p>

<hr class="l1" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>


<h2><a name="POLLOCK_AND_THE_PORROH_MAN" id="POLLOCK_AND_THE_PORROH_MAN">POLLOCK AND THE PORROH MAN</a></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">It</span> was in a swampy village on the lagoon river
behind the Turner Peninsula that Pollock&rsquo;s first
encounter with the Porroh man occurred. The
women of that country are famous for their good
looks&mdash;they are Gallinas with a dash of European
blood that dates from the days of Vasco de Gama
and the English slave-traders, and the Porroh man,
too, was possibly inspired by a faint Caucasian taint
in his composition. (It&rsquo;s a curious thing to think
that some of us may have distant cousins eating
men on Sherboro Island or raiding with the Sofas.)
At anyrate, the Porroh man stabbed the woman to
the heart as though he had been a mere low-class
Italian, and very narrowly missed Pollock. But
Pollock, using his revolver to parry the lightning
stab which was aimed at his deltoid muscle, sent
the iron dagger flying, and, firing, hit the man in
the hand.</p>

<p>He fired again and missed, knocking a sudden
window out of the wall of the hut. The Porroh
man stooped in the doorway, glancing under his
arm at Pollock. Pollock caught a glimpse of his
inverted face in the sunlight, and then the Englishman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
was alone, sick and trembling with the excitement
of the affair, in the twilight of the place. It
had all happened in less time than it takes to read
about it.</p>

<p>The woman was quite dead, and having ascertained
this, Pollock went to the entrance of the hut
and looked out. Things outside were dazzling
bright. Half a dozen of the porters of the expedition
were standing up in a group near the green
huts they occupied, and staring towards him, wondering
what the shots might signify. Behind the little
group of men was the broad stretch of black fetid
mud by the river, a green carpet of rafts of papyrus
and water-grass, and then the leaden water. The
mangroves beyond the stream loomed indistinctly
through the blue haze. There were no signs of
excitement in the squat village, whose fence was
just visible above the cane-grass.</p>

<p>Pollock came out of the hut cautiously and walked
towards the river, looking over his shoulder at intervals.
But the Porroh man had vanished. Pollock
clutched his revolver nervously in his hand.</p>

<p>One of his men came to meet him, and as he
came, pointed to the bushes behind the hut in which
the Porroh man had disappeared. Pollock had an
irritating persuasion of having made an absolute
fool of himself; he felt bitter, savage, at the turn
things had taken. At the same time, he would have
to tell Waterhouse&mdash;the moral, exemplary, cautious
Waterhouse&mdash;who would inevitably take the matter
seriously. Pollock cursed bitterly at his luck, at
Waterhouse, and especially at the West Coast of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
Africa. He felt consummately sick of the expedition.
And in the back of his mind all the time
was a speculative doubt where precisely within the
visible horizon the Porroh man might be.</p>

<p>It is perhaps rather shocking, but he was not at
all upset by the murder that had just happened.
He had seen so much brutality during the last three
months, so many dead women, burnt huts, drying
skeletons, up the Kittam River in the wake of the
Sofa cavalry, that his senses were blunted. What
disturbed him was the persuasion that this business
was only beginning.</p>

<p>He swore savagely at the black, who ventured to
ask a question, and went on into the tent under the
orange-trees where Waterhouse was lying, feeling
exasperatingly like a boy going into the headmaster&rsquo;s
study.</p>

<p>Waterhouse was still sleeping off the effects of his
last dose of chlorodyne, and Pollock sat down on a
packing-case beside him, and, lighting his pipe,
waited for him to awake. About him were scattered
the pots and weapons Waterhouse had collected
from the Mendi people, and which he had been
repacking for the canoe voyage to Sulyma.</p>

<p>Presently Waterhouse woke up, and after judicial
stretching, decided he was all right again. Pollock
got him some tea. Over the tea the incidents of
the afternoon were described by Pollock, after some
preliminary beating about the bush. Waterhouse
took the matter even more seriously than Pollock
had anticipated. He did not simply disapprove, he
scolded, he insulted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re one of those infernal fools who think a
black man isn&rsquo;t a human being,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
be ill a day without you must get into some dirty
scrape or other. This is the third time in a month
that you have come crossways-on with a native, and
this time you&rsquo;re in for it with a vengeance. Porroh,
too! They&rsquo;re down upon you enough as it is, about
that idol you wrote your silly name on. And they&rsquo;re
the most vindictive devils on earth! You make a
man ashamed of civilisation. To think you come
of a decent family! If ever I cumber myself up
with a vicious, stupid young lout like you again&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Steady on, now,&rdquo; snarled Pollock, in the tone
that always exasperated Waterhouse; &ldquo;steady on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that Waterhouse became speechless. He
jumped to his feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, Pollock,&rdquo; he said, after a struggle to
control his breath. &ldquo;You must go home. I won&rsquo;t
have you any longer. I&rsquo;m ill enough as it is through
you&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep your hair on,&rdquo; said Pollock, staring in front
of him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready enough to go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Waterhouse became calmer again. He sat down
on the camp-stool. &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
want a row, Pollock, you know, but it&rsquo;s confoundedly
annoying to have one&rsquo;s plans put out by this kind
of thing. I&rsquo;ll come to Sulyma with you, and see
you safe aboard&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Pollock. &ldquo;I can go alone.
From here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not far,&rdquo; said Waterhouse. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand
this Porroh business.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;How should <em>I</em> know she belonged to a Porroh
man?&rdquo; said Pollock bitterly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, she did,&rdquo; said Waterhouse; &ldquo;and you can&rsquo;t
undo the thing. Go alone, indeed! I wonder what
they&rsquo;d do to you. You don&rsquo;t seem to understand
that this Porroh hokey-pokey rules this country, is
its law, religion, constitution, medicine, magic....
They appoint the chiefs. The Inquisition, at its
best, couldn&rsquo;t hold a candle to these chaps. He
will probably set Awajale, the chief here, on to us.
It&rsquo;s lucky our porters are Mendis. We shall have
to shift this little settlement of ours.... Confound
you, Pollock! And, of course, you must go and
miss him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He thought, and his thoughts seemed disagreeable.
Presently he stood up and took his rifle. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
keep close for a bit, if I were you,&rdquo; he said, over his
shoulder, as he went out. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going out to see
what I can find out about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pollock remained sitting in the tent, meditating.
&ldquo;I was meant for a civilised life,&rdquo; he said to himself,
regretfully, as he filled his pipe. &ldquo;The sooner I get
back to London or Paris the better for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His eye fell on the sealed case in which Waterhouse
had put the featherless poisoned arrows they
had bought in the Mendi country. &ldquo;I wish I had
hit the beggar somewhere vital,&rdquo; said Pollock
viciously.</p>

<p>Waterhouse came back after a long interval. He
was not communicative, though Pollock asked him
questions enough. The Porroh man, it seems, was
a prominent member of that mystical society. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
village was interested, but not threatening. No
doubt the witch-doctor had gone into the bush. He
was a great witch-doctor. &ldquo;Of course, he&rsquo;s up to
something,&rdquo; said Waterhouse, and became silent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what can he do?&rdquo; asked Pollock, unheeded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must get you out of this. There&rsquo;s something
brewing, or things would not be so quiet,&rdquo; said
Waterhouse, after a gap of silence. Pollock wanted
to know what the brew might be. &ldquo;Dancing in a
circle of skulls,&rdquo; said Waterhouse; &ldquo;brewing a
stink in a copper pot.&rdquo; Pollock wanted particulars.
Waterhouse was vague, Pollock pressing. At last
Waterhouse lost his temper. &ldquo;How the devil should
<em>I</em> know?&rdquo; he said to Pollock&rsquo;s twentieth inquiry
what the Porroh man would do. &ldquo;He tried to kill
you off-hand in the hut. <em>Now</em>, I fancy he will try
something more elaborate. But you&rsquo;ll see fast
enough. I don&rsquo;t want to help unnerve you. It&rsquo;s
probably all nonsense.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That night, as they were sitting at their fire,
Pollock again tried to draw Waterhouse out on the
subject of Porroh methods. &ldquo;Better get to sleep,&rdquo;
said Waterhouse, when Pollock&rsquo;s bent became apparent;
&ldquo;we start early to-morrow. You may want
all your nerve about you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what line will he take?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say. They&rsquo;re versatile people. They
know a lot of rum dodges. You&rsquo;d better get that
copper-devil, Shakespear, to talk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a flash and a heavy bang out of the
darkness behind the huts, and a clay bullet came
whistling close to Pollock&rsquo;s head. This, at least,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
was crude enough. The blacks and half-breeds
sitting and yarning round their own fire jumped up,
and someone fired into the dark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better go into one of the huts,&rdquo; said Waterhouse
quietly, still sitting unmoved.</p>

<p>Pollock stood up by the fire and drew his revolver.
Fighting, at least, he was not afraid of.
But a man in the dark is in the best of armour.
Realising the wisdom of Waterhouse&rsquo;s advice, Pollock
went into the tent and lay down there.</p>

<p>What little sleep he had was disturbed by dreams,
variegated dreams, but chiefly of the Porroh man&rsquo;s
face, upside down, as he went out of the hut, and
looked up under his arm. It was odd that this
transitory impression should have stuck so firmly in
Pollock&rsquo;s memory. Moreover, he was troubled by
queer pains in his limbs.</p>

<p>In the white haze of the early morning, as they
were loading the canoes, a barbed arrow suddenly
appeared quivering in the ground close to Pollock&rsquo;s
foot. The boys made a perfunctory effort to clear
out the thicket, but it led to no capture.</p>

<p>After these two occurrences, there was a disposition
on the part of the expedition to leave Pollock
to himself, and Pollock became, for the first time in
his life, anxious to mingle with blacks. Waterhouse
took one canoe, and Pollock, in spite of a friendly
desire to chat with Waterhouse, had to take the
other. He was left all alone in the front part of the
canoe, and he had the greatest trouble to make the
men&mdash;who did not love him&mdash;keep to the middle
of the river, a clear hundred yards or more from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
either shore. However, he made Shakespear, the
Freetown half-breed, come up to his own end of the
canoe and tell him about Porroh, which Shakespear,
failing in his attempts to leave Pollock alone, presently
did with considerable freedom and gusto.</p>

<p>The day passed. The canoe glided swiftly along
the ribbon of lagoon water, between the drift of
water-figs, fallen trees, papyrus, and palm-wine
palms, and with the dark mangrove swamp to the
left, through which one could hear now and then
the roar of the Atlantic surf. Shakespear told in
his soft, blurred English of how the Porroh could
cast spells; how men withered up under their
malice; how they could send dreams and devils;
how they tormented and killed the sons of Ijibu;
how they kidnapped a white trader from Sulyma
who had maltreated one of the sect, and how his
body looked when it was found. And Pollock after
each narrative cursed under his breath at the want
of missionary enterprise that allowed such things to
be, and at the inert British Government that ruled
over this dark heathendom of Sierra Leone. In the
evening they came to the Kasi Lake, and sent a
score of crocodiles lumbering off the island on which
the expedition camped for the night.</p>

<p>The next day they reached Sulyma, and smelt
the sea breeze, but Pollock had to put up there
for five days before he could get on to Freetown.
Waterhouse, considering him to be comparatively
safe here, and within the pale of Freetown influence,
left him and went back with the expedition to
Gbemma, and Pollock became very friendly with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
Perera, the only resident white trader at Sulyma&mdash;so
friendly, indeed, that he went about with him
everywhere. Perera was a little Portuguese Jew,
who had lived in England, and he appreciated the
Englishman&rsquo;s friendliness as a great compliment.</p>

<p>For two days nothing happened out of the
ordinary; for the most part Pollock and Perera
played Nap&mdash;the only game they had in common&mdash;and
Pollock got into debt. Then, on the second
evening, Pollock had a disagreeable intimation of the
arrival of the Porroh man in Sulyma by getting a
flesh-wound in the shoulder from a lump of filed iron.
It was a long shot, and the missile had nearly spent
its force when it hit him. Still it conveyed its
message plainly enough. Pollock sat up in his
hammock, revolver in hand, all that night, and next
morning confided, to some extent, in the Anglo-Portuguese.</p>

<p>Perera took the matter seriously. He knew the
local customs pretty thoroughly. &ldquo;It is a personal
question, you must know. It is revenge. And of
course he is hurried by your leaving de country.
None of de natives or half-breeds will interfere wid
him very much&mdash;unless you make it wort deir while.
If you come upon him suddenly, you might shoot
him. But den he might shoot you.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Den dere&rsquo;s dis&mdash;infernal magic,&rdquo; said Perera.
&ldquo;Of course, I don&rsquo;t believe in it&mdash;superstition&mdash;but
still it&rsquo;s not nice to tink dat wherever you are, dere
is a black man, who spends a moonlight night now
and den a-dancing about a fire to send you bad
dreams.... Had any bad dreams?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Rather,&rdquo; said Pollock. &ldquo;I keep on seeing the
beggar&rsquo;s head upside down grinning at me and
showing all his teeth as he did in the hut, and
coming close up to me, and then going ever so far
off, and coming back. It&rsquo;s nothing to be afraid of,
but somehow it simply paralyses me with terror in
my sleep. Queer things&mdash;dreams. I know it&rsquo;s a
dream all the time, and I can&rsquo;t wake up from it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably only fancy,&rdquo; said Perera. &ldquo;Den
my niggers say Porroh men can send snakes. Seen
any snakes lately?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only one. I killed him this morning, on the
floor near my hammock. Almost trod on him as
I got up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Ah!</em>&rdquo; said Perera, and then, reassuringly, &ldquo;Of
course it is a&mdash;coincidence. Still I would keep my
eyes open. Den dere&rsquo;s pains in de bones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought they were due to miasma,&rdquo; said
Pollock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Probably dey are. When did dey begin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Pollock remembered that he first noticed
them the night after the fight in the hut. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
my opinion he don&rsquo;t want to kill you,&rdquo; said Perera&mdash;&ldquo;at
least not yet. I&rsquo;ve heard deir idea is to
scare and worry a man wid deir spells, and narrow
misses, and rheumatic pains, and bad dreams, and
all dat, until he&rsquo;s sick of life. Of course, it&rsquo;s all
talk, you know. You mustn&rsquo;t worry about it....
But I wonder what he&rsquo;ll be up to next.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>I</em> shall have to be up to something first,&rdquo;
said Pollock, staring gloomily at the greasy cards
that Perera was putting on the table. &ldquo;It don&rsquo;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
suit my dignity to be followed about, and shot at,
and blighted in this way. I wonder if Porroh hokey-pokey
upsets your luck at cards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked at Perera suspiciously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very likely it does,&rdquo; said Perera warmly, shuffling.
&ldquo;Dey are wonderful people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That afternoon Pollock killed two snakes in his
hammock, and there was also an extraordinary increase
in the number of red ants that swarmed over
the place; and these annoyances put him in a fit
temper to talk over business with a certain Mendi
rough he had interviewed before. The Mendi rough
showed Pollock a little iron dagger, and demonstrated
where one struck in the neck, in a way that made
Pollock shiver, and in return for certain considerations
Pollock promised him a double-barrelled gun with
an ornamental lock.</p>

<p>In the evening, as Pollock and Perera were playing
cards, the Mendi rough came in through the
doorway, carrying something in a blood-soaked piece
of native cloth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not here!&rdquo; said Pollock very hurriedly. &ldquo;Not
here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But he was not quick enough to prevent the man,
who was anxious to get to Pollock&rsquo;s side of the
bargain, from opening the cloth and throwing the
head of the Porroh man upon the table. It bounded
from there on to the floor, leaving a red trail on the
cards, and rolled into a corner, where it came to rest
upside down, but glaring hard at Pollock.</p>

<p>Perera jumped up as the thing fell among the
cards, and began in his excitement to gabble in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
Portuguese. The Mendi was bowing, with the red
cloth in his hand. &ldquo;De gun!&rdquo; he said. Pollock
stared back at the head in the corner. It bore
exactly the expression it had in his dreams. Something
seemed to snap in his own brain as he looked
at it.</p>

<p>Then Perera found his English again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You got him killed?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You did not
kill him yourself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should I?&rdquo; said Pollock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he will not be able to take it off now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take <em>what</em> off?&rdquo; said Pollock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And all dese cards are spoiled!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>What</em> do you mean by taking off?&rdquo; said
Pollock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must send me a new pack from Freetown.
You can buy dem dere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&lsquo;take it off&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is only superstition. I forgot. De niggers
say dat if de witches&mdash;he was a witch&mdash; But it is
rubbish.... You must make de Porroh man take
it off, or kill him yourself.... It is very silly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pollock swore under his breath, still staring hard
at the head in the corner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stand that glare,&rdquo; he said. Then suddenly
he rushed at the thing and kicked it. It
rolled some yards or so, and came to rest in the
same position as before, upside down, and looking
at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is ugly,&rdquo; said the Anglo-Portuguese. &ldquo;Very
ugly. Dey do it on deir faces with little knives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pollock would have kicked the head again, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
the Mendi man touched him on the arm. &ldquo;De
gun?&rdquo; he said, looking nervously at the head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two&mdash;if you will take that beastly thing away,&rdquo;
said Pollock.</p>

<p>The Mendi shook his head, and intimated that
he only wanted one gun now due to him, and for
which he would be obliged. Pollock found neither
cajolery nor bullying any good with him. Perera
had a gun to sell (at a profit of three hundred per
cent.), and with that the man presently departed.
Then Pollock&rsquo;s eyes, against his will, were recalled
to the thing on the floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is funny dat his head keeps upside down,&rdquo;
said Perera, with an uneasy laugh. &ldquo;His brains
must be heavy, like de weight in de little images
one sees dat keep always upright wid lead in dem.
You will take him wiv you when you go presently.
You might take him now. De cards are all spoilt.
Dere is a man sell dem in Freetown. De room is
in a filty mess as it is. You should have killed him
yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pollock pulled himself together, and went and
picked up the head. He would hang it up by the
lamp-hook in the middle of the ceiling of his room,
and dig a grave for it at once. He was under the
impression that he hung it up by the hair, but that
must have been wrong, for when he returned for it,
it was hanging by the neck upside down.</p>

<p>He buried it before sunset on the north side of
the shed he occupied, so that he should not have to
pass the grave after dark when he was returning
from Perera&rsquo;s. He killed two snakes before he went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
to sleep. In the darkest part of the night he awoke
with a start, and heard a pattering sound and something
scraping on the floor. He sat up noiselessly,
and felt under his pillow for his revolver. A
mumbling growl followed, and Pollock fired at the
sound. There was a yelp, and something dark
passed for a moment across the hazy blue of the
doorway. &ldquo;A dog!&rdquo; said Pollock, lying down
again.</p>

<p>In the early dawn he awoke again with a peculiar
sense of unrest. The vague pain in his bones had
returned. For some time he lay watching the red
ants that were swarming over the ceiling, and then,
as the light grew brighter, he looked over the edge
of his hammock and saw something dark on the
floor. He gave such a violent start that the hammock
overset and flung him out.</p>

<p>He found himself lying, perhaps, a yard away
from the head of the Porroh man. It had been
disinterred by the dog, and the nose was grievously
battered. Ants and flies swarmed over it. By an
odd coincidence, it was still upside down, and with
the same diabolical expression in the inverted eyes.</p>

<p>Pollock sat paralysed, and stared at the horror for
some time. Then he got up and walked round it&mdash;giving
it a wide berth&mdash;and out of the shed. The
clear light of the sunrise, the living stir of vegetation
before the breath of the dying land-breeze, and the
empty grave with the marks of the dog&rsquo;s paws,
lightened the weight upon his mind a little.</p>

<p>He told Perera of the business as though it was a
jest&mdash;a jest to be told with white lips. &ldquo;You should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
not have frighten de dog,&rdquo; said Perera, with poorly
simulated hilarity.</p>

<p>The next two days, until the steamer came, were
spent by Pollock in making a more effectual disposition
of his possession. Overcoming his aversion
to handling the thing, he went down to the river
mouth and threw it into the sea-water, but by some
miracle it escaped the crocodiles, and was cast up by
the tide on the mud a little way up the river, to be
found by an intelligent Arab half-breed, and offered
for sale to Pollock and Perera as a curiosity, just on
the edge of night. The native hung about in the
brief twilight, making lower and lower offers, and at
last, getting scared in some way by the evident dread
these wise white men had for the thing, went off,
and, passing Pollock&rsquo;s shed, threw his burden in
there for Pollock to discover in the morning.</p>

<p>At this Pollock got into a kind of frenzy. He
would burn the thing. He went out straightway
into the dawn, and had constructed a big pyre of
brushwood before the heat of the day. He was
interrupted by the hooter of the little paddle steamer
from Monrovia to Bathurst, which was coming
through the gap in the bar. &ldquo;Thank Heaven!&rdquo;
said Pollock, with infinite piety, when the meaning
of the sound dawned upon him. With trembling
hands he lit his pile of wood hastily, threw the head
upon it, and went away to pack his portmanteau
and make his adieux to Perera.</p>

<p>That afternoon, with a sense of infinite relief,
Pollock watched the flat swampy foreshore of Sulyma
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>grow small in the distance. The gap in the long
line of white surge became narrower and narrower.
It seemed to be closing in and cutting him off from
his trouble. The feeling of dread and worry began
to slip from him bit by bit. At Sulyma belief in
Porroh malignity and Porroh magic had been in the
air, his sense of Porroh had been vast, pervading,
threatening, dreadful. Now manifestly the domain
of Porroh was only a little place, a little black band
between the sea and the blue cloudy Mendi uplands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Porroh!&rdquo; said Pollock. &ldquo;Good-bye&mdash;certainly
not <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au revoir</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain of the steamer came and leant over
the rail beside him, and wished him good-evening,
and spat at the froth of the wake in token of
friendly ease.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I picked up a rummy curio on the beach this
go,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a thing I never saw
done this side of Indy before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What might that be?&rdquo; said Pollock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pickled &rsquo;ed,&rdquo; said the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>What?</em>&rdquo; said Pollock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ed&mdash;smoked. &rsquo;Ed of one of these Porroh
chaps, all ornamented with knife-cuts. Why!
What&rsquo;s up? Nothing? I shouldn&rsquo;t have took you
for a nervous chap. Green in the face. By gosh!
you&rsquo;re a bad sailor. All right, eh? Lord, how
funny you went!... Well, this &rsquo;ed I was telling
you of is a bit rum in a way. I&rsquo;ve got it, along
with some snakes, in a jar of spirit in my cabin what
I keeps for such curios, and I&rsquo;m hanged if it don&rsquo;t
float upsy down. Hullo!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pollock had given an incoherent cry, and had his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
hands in his hair. He ran towards the paddle-boxes
with a half-formed idea of jumping into the
sea, and then he realised his position and turned
back towards the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;Jack Philips, just
keep him off me! Stand off! No nearer, mister!
What&rsquo;s the matter with you? Are you mad?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pollock put his hand to his head. It was no
good explaining. &ldquo;I believe I am pretty nearly
mad at times,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pain I have here.
Comes suddenly. You&rsquo;ll excuse me, I hope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was white and in a perspiration. He saw
suddenly very clearly all the danger he ran of having
his sanity doubted. He forced himself to restore the
captain&rsquo;s confidence, by answering his sympathetic inquiries,
noting his suggestions, even trying a spoonful
of neat brandy in his cheek, and, that matter settled,
asking a number of questions about the captain&rsquo;s
private trade in curiosities. The captain described
the head in detail. All the while Pollock was
struggling to keep under a preposterous persuasion
that the ship was as transparent as glass, and that
he could distinctly see the inverted face looking at
him from the cabin beneath his feet.</p>

<p>Pollock had a worse time almost on the steamer
than he had at Sulyma. All day he had to control
himself in spite of his intense perception of the
imminent presence of that horrible head that was
overshadowing his mind. At night his old nightmare
returned, until, with a violent effort, he would
force himself awake, rigid with the horror of it, and
with the ghost of a hoarse scream in his throat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>He left the actual head behind at Bathurst, where
he changed ship for Teneriffe, but not his dreams
nor the dull ache in his bones. At Teneriffe Pollock
transferred to a Cape liner, but the head followed
him. He gambled, he tried chess, he even read
books, but he knew the danger of drink. Yet whenever
a round black shadow, a round black object
came into his range, there he looked for the head,
and&mdash;saw it. He knew clearly enough that his
imagination was growing traitor to him, and yet at
times it seemed the ship he sailed in, his fellow-passengers,
the sailors, the wide sea, was all part of a
filmy phantasmagoria that hung, scarcely veiling it,
between him and a horrible real world. Then the
Porroh man, thrusting his diabolical face through
that curtain, was the one real and undeniable thing.
At that he would get up and touch things, taste
something, gnaw something, burn his hand with a
match, or run a needle into himself.</p>

<p>So, struggling grimly and silently with his excited
imagination, Pollock reached England. He landed
at Southampton, and went on straight from Waterloo
to his banker&rsquo;s in Cornhill in a cab. There he
transacted some business with the manager in a
private room, and all the while the head hung like
an ornament under the black marble mantel and
dripped upon the fender. He could hear the drops
fall, and see the red on the fender.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A pretty fern,&rdquo; said the manager, following his
eyes. &ldquo;But it makes the fender rusty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very,&rdquo; said Pollock; &ldquo;a <em>very</em> pretty fern. And
that reminds me. Can you recommend me a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
physician for mind troubles? I&rsquo;ve got a little&mdash;what
is it?&mdash;hallucination.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The head laughed savagely, wildly. Pollock was
surprised the manager did not notice it. But the
manager only stared at his face.</p>

<p>With the address of a doctor, Pollock presently
emerged in Cornhill. There was no cab in sight,
and so he went on down to the western end of the
street, and essayed the crossing opposite the Mansion
House. The crossing is hardly easy even for the
expert Londoner; cabs, vans, carriages, mail-carts,
omnibuses go by in one incessant stream; to anyone
fresh from the malarious solitudes of Sierra Leone it
is a boiling, maddening confusion. But when an
inverted head suddenly comes bouncing, like an
indiarubber ball, between your legs, leaving distinct
smears of blood every time it touches the ground,
you can scarcely hope to avoid an accident. Pollock
lifted his feet convulsively to avoid it, and then
kicked at the thing furiously. Then something hit
him violently in the back, and a hot pain ran up his
arm.</p>

<p>He had been hit by the pole of an omnibus, and
three of the fingers of his left hand smashed by the
hoof of one of the horses&mdash;the very fingers, as it
happened, that he shot from the Porroh man. They
pulled him out from between the horses&rsquo; legs, and
found the address of the physician in his crushed
hand.</p>

<p>For a couple of days Pollock&rsquo;s sensations were
full of the sweet, pungent smell of chloroform, of
painful operations that caused him no pain, of lying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
still and being given food and drink. Then he had
a slight fever, and was very thirsty, and his old
nightmare came back. It was only when it returned
that he noticed it had left him for a day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If my skull had been smashed instead of my
fingers, it might have gone altogether,&rdquo; said Pollock,
staring thoughtfully at the dark cushion that had
taken on for the time the shape of the head.</p>

<p>Pollock at the first opportunity told the physician
of his mind trouble. He knew clearly that he must
go mad unless something should intervene to save
him. He explained that he had witnessed a
decapitation in Dahomey, and was haunted by
one of the heads. Naturally, he did not care to
state the actual facts. The physician looked
grave.</p>

<p>Presently he spoke hesitatingly. &ldquo;As a child,
did you get very much religious training?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very little,&rdquo; said Pollock.</p>

<p>A shade passed over the physician&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know if you have heard of the miraculous
cures&mdash;it may be, of course, they are not miraculous&mdash;at
Lourdes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Faith-healing will hardly suit me, I am afraid,&rdquo;
said Pollock, with his eye on the dark cushion.</p>

<p>The head distorted its scarred features in an
abominable grimace. The physician went upon a
new track. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all imagination,&rdquo; he said, speaking
with sudden briskness. &ldquo;A fair case for faith-healing,
anyhow. Your nervous system has run
down, you&rsquo;re in that twilight state of health when
the bogles come easiest. The strong impression was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
too much for you. I must make you up a little
mixture that will strengthen your nervous system&mdash;especially
your brain. And you must take
exercise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m no good for faith-healing,&rdquo; said Pollock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And therefore we must restore tone. Go in
search of stimulating air&mdash;Scotland, Norway, the
Alps&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jericho, if you like,&rdquo; said Pollock&mdash;&ldquo;where
Naaman went.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, so soon as his fingers would let him,
Pollock made a gallant attempt to follow out the
doctor&rsquo;s suggestion. It was now November. He
tried football, but to Pollock the game consisted in
kicking a furious inverted head about a field. He
was no good at the game. He kicked blindly, with
a kind of horror, and when they put him back into
goal, and the ball came swooping down upon him, he
suddenly yelled and got out of its way. The discreditable
stories that had driven him from England
to wander in the tropics shut him off from any but
men&rsquo;s society, and now his increasingly strange
behaviour made even his man friends avoid him.
The thing was no longer a thing of the eye merely;
it gibbered at him, spoke to him. A horrible fear
came upon him that presently, when he took hold of
the apparition, it would no longer become some mere
article of furniture, but would <em>feel</em> like a real dissevered
head. Alone, he would curse at the thing,
defy it, entreat it; once or twice, in spite of his grim
self-control, he addressed it in the presence of others.
He felt the growing suspicion in the eyes of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
people that watched him&mdash;his landlady, the servant,
his man.</p>

<p>One day early in December his cousin Arnold&mdash;his
next of kin&mdash;came to see him and draw him out,
and watch his sunken yellow face with narrow eager
eyes. And it seemed to Pollock that the hat his
cousin carried in his hand was no hat at all, but a
Gorgon head that glared at him upside down, and
fought with its eyes against his reason. However,
he was still resolute to see the matter out. He got
a bicycle, and, riding over the frosty road from
Wandsworth to Kingston, found the thing rolling
along at his side, and leaving a dark trail behind it.
He set his teeth and rode faster. Then suddenly,
as he came down the hill towards Richmond Park,
the apparition rolled in front of him and under his
wheel, so quickly that he had no time for thought,
and, turning quickly to avoid it, was flung violently
against a heap of stones and broke his left wrist.</p>

<p>The end came on Christmas morning. All night
he had been in a fever, the bandages encircling his
wrist like a band of fire, his dreams more vivid and
terrible than ever. In the cold, colourless, uncertain
light that came before the sunrise, he sat up in his
bed, and saw the head upon the bracket in the place
of the bronze jar that had stood there overnight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that is a bronze jar,&rdquo; he said, with a
chill doubt at his heart. Presently the doubt was
irresistible. He got out of bed slowly, shivering,
and advanced to the jar with his hand raised.
Surely he would see now his imagination had deceived
him, recognise the distinctive sheen of bronze.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
At last, after an age of hesitation, his fingers came
down on the patterned cheek of the head. He
withdrew them spasmodically. The last stage was
reached. His sense of touch had betrayed him.</p>

<p>Trembling, stumbling against the bed, kicking
against his shoes with his bare feet, a dark confusion
eddying round him, he groped his way to the
dressing-table, took his razor from the drawer, and
sat down on the bed with this in his hand. In the
looking-glass he saw his own face, colourless,
haggard, full of the ultimate bitterness of despair.</p>

<p>He beheld in swift succession the incidents in the
brief tale of his experience. His wretched home, his
still more wretched schooldays, the years of vicious
life he had led since then, one act of selfish dishonour
leading to another; it was all clear and pitiless now,
all its squalid folly, in the cold light of the dawn.
He came to the hut, to the fight with the Porroh
man, to the retreat down the river to Sulyma, to the
Mendi assassin and his red parcel, to his frantic
endeavours to destroy the head, to the growth of his
hallucination. It was a hallucination! He <em>knew</em>
it was. A hallucination merely. For a moment
he snatched at hope. He looked away from the
glass, and on the bracket, the inverted head grinned
and grimaced at him.... With the stiff fingers of
his bandaged hand he felt at his neck for the throb
of his arteries. The morning was very cold, the
steel blade felt like ice.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_RED_ROOM" id="THE_RED_ROOM">THE RED ROOM</a></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;I can</span> assure you,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that it will take
a very tangible ghost to frighten me.&rdquo; And
I stood up before the fire with my glass
in my hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is your own choosing,&rdquo; said the man with the
withered arm, and glanced at me askance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eight-and-twenty years,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I have lived,
and never a ghost have I seen as yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old woman sat staring hard into the fire, her
pale eyes wide open. &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; she broke in; &ldquo;and
eight-and-twenty years you have lived and never
seen the likes of this house, I reckon. There&rsquo;s a
many things to see, when one&rsquo;s still but eight-and-twenty.&rdquo;
She swayed her head slowly from side to
side. &ldquo;A many things to see and sorrow for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I half suspected the old people were trying to
enhance the spiritual terrors of their house by their
droning insistence. I put down my empty glass on
the table and looked about the room, and caught a
glimpse of myself, abbreviated and broadened to an
impossible sturdiness, in the queer old mirror at the
end of the room. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;if I see anything
to-night, I shall be so much the wiser. For I come
to the business with an open mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your own choosing,&rdquo; said the man with the
withered arm once more.</p>

<p>I heard the sound of a stick and a shambling
step on the flags in the passage outside, and the
door creaked on its hinges as a second old man
entered, more bent, more wrinkled, more aged even
than the first. He supported himself by a single
crutch, his eyes were covered by a shade, and his
lower lip, half-averted, hung pale and pink from his
decaying yellow teeth. He made straight for an
arm-chair on the opposite side of the table, sat
down clumsily, and began to cough. The man with
the withered arm gave this new-comer a short glance
of positive dislike; the old woman took no notice of
his arrival, but remained with her eyes fixed steadily
on the fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said&mdash;it&rsquo;s your own choosing,&rdquo; said the man
with the withered arm, when the coughing had
ceased for a while.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my own choosing,&rdquo; I answered.</p>

<p>The man with the shade became aware of my
presence for the first time, and threw his head back
for a moment and sideways, to see me. I caught a
momentary glimpse of his eyes, small and bright
and inflamed. Then he began to cough and splutter
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you drink?&rdquo; said the man with the
withered arm, pushing the beer towards him. The
man with the shade poured out a glassful with a
shaky arm that splashed half as much again on the
deal table. A monstrous shadow of him crouched
upon the wall and mocked his action as he poured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
and drank. I must confess I had scarce expected
these grotesque custodians. There is to my mind
something inhuman in senility, something crouching
and atavistic; the human qualities seem to drop
from old people insensibly day by day. The three
of them made me feel uncomfortable, with their gaunt
silences, their bent carriage, their evident unfriendliness
to me and to one another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you will show me to this haunted
room of yours, I will make myself comfortable there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old man with the cough jerked his head back
so suddenly that it startled me, and shot another
glance of his red eyes at me from under the shade;
but no one answered me. I waited a minute, glancing
from one to the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If,&rdquo; I said a little louder, &ldquo;if you will show me
to this haunted room of yours, I will relieve you from
the task of entertaining me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a candle on the slab outside the door,&rdquo;
said the man with the withered arm, looking at my
feet as he addressed me. &ldquo;But if you go to the red
room to-night&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>(&ldquo;This night of all nights!&rdquo; said the old woman.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;You go alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;And which way
do I go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You go along the passage for a bit,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;until you come to a door, and through that is a
spiral staircase, and half-way up that is a landing
and another door covered with baize. Go through
that and down the long corridor to the end, and the
red room is on your left up the steps.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Have I got that right?&rdquo; I said, and repeated his
directions. He corrected me in one particular.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And are you really going?&rdquo; said the man
with the shade, looking at me again for the
third time, with that queer, unnatural tilting of
the face.</p>

<p>(&ldquo;This night of all nights!&rdquo; said the old
woman.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is what I came for,&rdquo; I said, and moved towards
the door. As I did so, the old man with the
shade rose and staggered round the table, so as to
be closer to the others and to the fire. At the door
I turned and looked at them, and saw they were all
close together, dark against the firelight, staring at
me over their shoulders, with an intent expression on
their ancient faces.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; I said, setting the door open.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your own choosing,&rdquo; said the man with the
withered arm.</p>

<p>I left the door wide open until the candle was well
alight, and then I shut them in and walked down the
chilly, echoing passage.</p>

<p>I must confess that the oddness of these three old
pensioners in whose charge her ladyship had left the
castle, and the deep-toned, old-fashioned furniture of
the housekeeper&rsquo;s room in which they foregathered,
affected me in spite of my efforts to keep myself at
a matter-of-fact phase. They seemed to belong to
another age, an older age, an age when things
spiritual were different from this of ours, less certain;
an age when omens and witches were credible, and
ghosts beyond denying. Their very existence was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
spectral; the cut of their clothing, fashions born in
dead brains. The ornaments and conveniences of
the room about them were ghostly&mdash;the thoughts
of vanished men, which still haunted rather than
participated in the world of to-day. But with an
effort I sent such thoughts to the right-about. The
long, draughty subterranean passage was chilly and
dusty, and my candle flared and made the shadows
cower and quiver. The echoes rang up and down
the spiral staircase, and a shadow came sweeping up
after me, and one fled before me into the darkness
overhead. I came to the landing and stopped there
for a moment, listening to a rustling that I fancied
I heard; then, satisfied of the absolute silence, I
pushed open the baize-covered door and stood in
the corridor.</p>

<p>The effect was scarcely what I expected, for the
moonlight, coming in by the great window on the
grand staircase, picked out everything in vivid black
shadow or silvery illumination. Everything was in
its place: the house might have been deserted on
the yesterday instead of eighteen months ago. There
were candles in the sockets of the sconces, and whatever
dust had gathered on the carpets or upon the
polished flooring was distributed so evenly as to be
invisible in the moonlight. I was about to advance,
and stopped abruptly. A bronze group stood upon
the landing, hidden from me by the corner of the
wall, but its shadow fell with marvellous distinctness
upon the white panelling, and gave me the
impression of someone crouching to waylay me. I
stood rigid for half a minute perhaps. Then, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
my hand in the pocket that held my revolver, I
advanced, only to discover a Ganymede and Eagle
glistening in the moonlight. That incident for a
time restored my nerve, and a porcelain Chinaman
on a buhl table, whose head rocked silently as I
passed him, scarcely startled me.</p>

<p>The door to the red room and the steps up to it
were in a shadowy corner. I moved my candle
from side to side, in order to see clearly the nature
of the recess in which I stood before opening the
door. Here it was, thought I, that my predecessor
was found, and the memory of that story gave me
a sudden twinge of apprehension. I glanced over
my shoulder at the Ganymede in the moonlight, and
opened the door of the red room rather hastily, with my
face half turned to the pallid silence of the landing.</p>

<p>I entered, closed the door behind me at once,
turned the key I found in the lock within, and stood
with the candle held aloft, surveying the scene of
my vigil, the great red room of Lorraine Castle, in
which the young duke had died. Or, rather, in
which he had begun his dying, for he had opened
the door and fallen headlong down the steps I had
just ascended. That had been the end of his vigil,
of his gallant attempt to conquer the ghostly tradition
of the place, and never, I thought, had apoplexy
better served the ends of superstition. And there
were other and older stories that clung to the room,
back to the half-credible beginning of it all, the tale
of a timid wife and the tragic end that came to her
husband&rsquo;s jest of frightening her. And looking
around that large shadowy room, with its shadowy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
window bays, its recesses and alcoves, one could
well understand the legends that had sprouted in
its black corners, its germinating darkness. My
candle was a little tongue of light in its vastness,
that failed to pierce the opposite end of the room,
and left an ocean of mystery and suggestion beyond
its island of light.</p>

<p>I resolved to make a systematic examination of
the place at once, and dispel the fanciful suggestions
of its obscurity before they obtained a hold upon
me. After satisfying myself of the fastening of the
door, I began to walk about the room, peering round
each article of furniture, tucking up the valances of
the bed, and opening its curtains wide. I pulled up
the blinds and examined the fastenings of the several
windows before closing the shutters, leant forward
and looked up the blackness of the wide chimney,
and tapped the dark oak panelling for any secret
opening. There were two big mirrors in the room,
each with a pair of sconces bearing candles, and on
the mantelshelf, too, were more candles in china
candlesticks. All these I lit one after the other.
The fire was laid,&mdash;an unexpected consideration from
the old housekeeper,&mdash;and I lit it, to keep down any
disposition to shiver, and when it was burning well,
I stood round with my back to it and regarded the
room again. I had pulled up a chintz-covered arm-chair
and a table, to form a kind of barricade before
me, and on this lay my revolver ready to hand. My
precise examination had done me good, but I still
found the remoter darkness of the place, and its
perfect stillness, too stimulating for the imagination.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
The echoing of the stir and crackling of the fire was
no sort of comfort to me. The shadow in the alcove,
at the end in particular, had that undefinable quality
of a presence, that odd suggestion of a lurking living
thing, that comes so easily in silence and solitude.
At last, to reassure myself, I walked with a candle
into it, and satisfied myself that there was nothing
tangible there. I stood that candle upon the floor
of the alcove, and left it in that position.</p>

<p>By this time I was in a state of considerable
nervous tension, although to my reason there was
no adequate cause for the condition. My mind,
however, was perfectly clear. I postulated quite
unreservedly that nothing supernatural could happen,
and to pass the time I began to string some rhymes
together, Ingoldsby fashion, of the original legend of
the place. A few I spoke aloud, but the echoes
were not pleasant. For the same reason I also
abandoned, after a time, a conversation with myself
upon the impossibility of ghosts and haunting. My
mind reverted to the three old and distorted people
downstairs, and I tried to keep it upon that topic.
The sombre reds and blacks of the room troubled
me; even with seven candles the place was merely
dim. The one in the alcove flared in a draught,
and the fire-flickering kept the shadows and penumbra
perpetually shifting and stirring. Casting
about for a remedy, I recalled the candles I had
seen in the passage, and, with a slight effort, walked
out into the moonlight, carrying a candle and leaving
the door open, and presently returned with as many
as ten. These I put in various knick-knacks of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
china with which the room was sparsely adorned,
lit and placed where the shadows had lain deepest,
some on the floor, some in the window recesses,
until at last my seventeen candles were so arranged
that not an inch of the room but had the direct
light of at least one of them. It occurred to me that
when the ghost came, I could warn him not to trip
over them. The room was now quite brightly
illuminated. There was something very cheery and
reassuring in these little streaming flames, and snuffing
them gave me an occupation, and afforded a
reassuring sense of the passage of time.</p>

<p>Even with that, however, the brooding expectation
of the vigil weighed heavily upon me. It was after
midnight that the candle in the alcove suddenly
went out, and the black shadow sprang back to its
place there. I did not see the candle go out; I
simply turned and saw that the darkness was there,
as one might start and see the unexpected presence
of a stranger. &ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; said I aloud; &ldquo;that
draught&rsquo;s a strong one!&rdquo; and, taking the matches
from the table, I walked across the room in a
leisurely manner to relight the corner again. My
first match would not strike, and as I succeeded
with the second, something seemed to blink on the
wall before me. I turned my head involuntarily, and
saw that the two candles on the little table by the
fireplace were extinguished. I rose at once to my
feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Odd!&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Did I do that myself in a
flash of absent-mindedness?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I walked back, relit one, and as I did so, I saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
the candle in the right sconce of one of the mirrors
wink and go right out, and almost immediately its
companion followed it. There was no mistake about
it. The flame vanished, as if the wicks had been
suddenly nipped between a finger and a thumb,
leaving the wick neither glowing nor smoking, but
black. While I stood gaping, the candle at the foot
of the bed went out, and the shadows seemed to
take another step towards me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This won&rsquo;t do!&rdquo; said I, and first one and then
another candle on the mantelshelf followed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; I cried, with a queer high note
getting into my voice somehow. At that the candle
on the wardrobe went out, and the one I had relit
in the alcove followed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Steady on!&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;These candles are
wanted,&rdquo; speaking with a half-hysterical facetiousness,
and scratching away at a match the while for
the mantel candlesticks. My hands trembled so
much that twice I missed the rough paper of the
matchbox. As the mantel emerged from darkness
again, two candles in the remoter end of the window
were eclipsed. But with the same match I also
relit the larger mirror candles, and those on the floor
near the doorway, so that for the moment I seemed
to gain on the extinctions. But then in a volley
there vanished four lights at once in different corners
of the room, and I struck another match in quivering
haste, and stood hesitating whither to take it.</p>

<p>As I stood undecided, an invisible hand seemed to
sweep out the two candles on the table. With a cry
of terror, I dashed at the alcove, then into the corner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
and then into the window, relighting three, as two
more vanished by the fireplace; then, perceiving a
better way, I dropped the matches on the iron-bound
deed-box in the corner, and caught up the bedroom
candlestick. With this I avoided the delay of striking
matches; but for all that the steady process of extinction
went on, and the shadows I feared and fought
against returned, and crept in upon me, first a step
gained on this side of me and then on that. It was
like a ragged storm-cloud sweeping out the stars.
Now and then one returned for a minute, and was lost
again. I was now almost frantic with the horror of
the coming darkness, and my self-possession deserted
me. I leaped panting and dishevelled from candle
to candle, in a vain struggle against that remorseless
advance.</p>

<p>I bruised myself on the thigh against the table,
I sent a chair headlong, I stumbled and fell and
whisked the cloth from the table in my fall. My
candle rolled away from me, and I snatched another
as I rose. Abruptly this was blown out, as I swung
it off the table, by the wind of my sudden movement,
and immediately the two remaining candles
followed. But there was light still in the room, a
red light that staved off the shadows from me. The
fire! Of course, I could still thrust my candle
between the bars and relight it!</p>

<p>I turned to where the flames were still dancing
between the glowing coals, and splashing red reflections
upon the furniture, made two steps towards the
grate, and incontinently the flames dwindled and
vanished, the glow vanished, the reflections rushed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
together and vanished, and as I thrust the candle
between the bars, darkness closed upon me like the
shutting of an eye, wrapped about me in a stifling
embrace, sealed my vision, and crushed the last
vestiges of reason from my brain. The candle fell
from my hand. I flung out my arms in a vain
effort to thrust that ponderous blackness away from
me, and, lifting up my voice, screamed with all my
might&mdash;once, twice, thrice. Then I think I must
have staggered to my feet. I know I thought
suddenly of the moonlit corridor, and, with my head
bowed and my arms over my face, made a run for
the door.</p>

<p>But I had forgotten the exact position of the
door, and struck myself heavily against the corner
of the bed. I staggered back, turned, and was
either struck or struck myself against some other
bulky furniture. I have a vague memory of battering
myself thus, to and fro in the darkness, of a
cramped struggle, and of my own wild crying as I
darted to and fro, of a heavy blow at last upon my
forehead, a horrible sensation of falling that lasted
an age, of my last frantic effort to keep my footing,
and then I remember no more.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>I opened my eyes in daylight. My head was
roughly bandaged, and the man with the withered
arm was watching my face. I looked about me,
trying to remember what had happened, and for a
space I could not recollect. I rolled my eyes into
the corner, and saw the old woman, no longer
abstracted, pouring out some drops of medicine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
from a little blue phial into a glass. &ldquo;Where am
I?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;I seem to remember you, and yet
I cannot remember who you are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They told me then, and I heard of the haunted
Red Room as one who hears a tale. &ldquo;We found
you at dawn,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and there was blood on
your forehead and lips.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was very slowly I recovered my memory of
my experience. &ldquo;You believe now,&rdquo; said the old
man, &ldquo;that the room is haunted?&rdquo; He spoke no
longer as one who greets an intruder, but as one
who grieves for a broken friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;the room is haunted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you have seen it. And we, who have lived
here all our lives, have never set eyes upon it.
Because we have never dared.... Tell us, is it
truly the old earl who&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;it is not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you so,&rdquo; said the old lady, with the glass
in her hand. &ldquo;It is his poor young countess who
was frightened&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;There is neither ghost of
earl nor ghost of countess in that room, there is no
ghost there at all; but worse, far worse&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; they said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The worst of all the things that haunt poor
mortal man,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;and that is, in all its nakedness&mdash;<em>Fear!</em>
Fear that will not have light nor
sound, that will not bear with reason, that deafens
and darkens and overwhelms. It followed me
through the corridor, it fought against me in the
room&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>I stopped abruptly. There was an interval of
silence. My hand went up to my bandages.</p>

<p>Then the man with the shade sighed and spoke.
&ldquo;That is it,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I knew that was it. A
Power of Darkness. To put such a curse upon a
woman! It lurks there always. You can feel it
even in the daytime, even of a bright summer&rsquo;s
day, in the hangings, in the curtains, keeping behind
you however you face about. In the dusk it creeps
along the corridor and follows you, so that you dare
not turn. There is Fear in that room of hers&mdash;black
Fear, and there will be&mdash;so long as this house of sin
endures.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="THE_CONE" id="THE_CONE">THE CONE</a></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">The</span> night was hot and overcast, the sky red-rimmed
with the lingering sunset of midsummer.
They sat at the open window,
trying to fancy the air was fresher there. The
trees and shrubs of the garden stood stiff and
dark; beyond in the roadway a gas-lamp burnt,
bright orange against the hazy blue of the evening.
Farther were the three lights of the railway signal
against the lowering sky. The man and woman
spoke to one another in low tones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He does not suspect?&rdquo; said the man, a little
nervously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not he,&rdquo; she said peevishly, as though that too
irritated her. &ldquo;He thinks of nothing but the works
and the prices of fuel. He has no imagination, no
poetry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None of these men of iron have,&rdquo; he said sententiously.
&ldquo;They have no hearts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>He</em> has not,&rdquo; she said. She turned her discontented
face towards the window. The distant
sound of a roaring and rushing drew nearer and
grew in volume; the house quivered; one heard
the metallic rattle of the tender. As the train<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
passed, there was a glare of light above the cutting
and a driving tumult of smoke; one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight black oblongs&mdash;eight
trucks&mdash;passed across the dim grey of the embankment,
and were suddenly extinguished one by one
in the throat of the tunnel, which, with the last,
seemed to swallow down train, smoke, and sound
in one abrupt gulp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This country was all fresh and beautiful once,&rdquo;
he said; &ldquo;and now&mdash;it is Gehenna. Down that
way&mdash;nothing but pot-banks and chimneys belching
fire and dust into the face of heaven.... But what
does it matter? An end comes, an end to all this
cruelty.... <em>To-morrow.</em>&rdquo; He spoke the last word
in a whisper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>To-morrow</em>,&rdquo; she said, speaking in a whisper too,
and still staring out of the window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear!&rdquo; he said, putting his hand on hers.</p>

<p>She turned with a start, and their eyes searched
one another&rsquo;s. Hers softened to his gaze. &ldquo;My
dear one!&rdquo; she said, and then: &ldquo;It seems so strange&mdash;that
you should have come into my life like this&mdash;to
open&rdquo;&mdash; She paused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To open?&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All this wonderful world&rdquo;&mdash;she hesitated, and
spoke still more softly&mdash;&ldquo;this world of <em>love</em> to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then suddenly the door clicked and closed. They
turned their heads, and he started violently back.
In the shadow of the room stood a great shadowy
figure&mdash;silent. They saw the face dimly in the
half-light, with unexpressive dark patches under
the penthouse brows. Every muscle in Raut&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
body suddenly became tense. When could the
door have opened? What had he heard? Had
he heard all? What had he seen? A tumult of
questions.</p>

<p>The new-comer&rsquo;s voice came at last, after a pause
that seemed interminable. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was afraid I had missed you, Horrocks,&rdquo; said
the man at the window, gripping the window-ledge
with his hand. His voice was unsteady.</p>

<p>The clumsy figure of Horrocks came forward out
of the shadow. He made no answer to Raut&rsquo;s
remark. For a moment he stood above them.</p>

<p>The woman&rsquo;s heart was cold within her. &ldquo;I told
Mr. Raut it was just possible you might come back,&rdquo;
she said, in a voice that never quivered.</p>

<p>Horrocks, still silent, sat down abruptly in the
chair by her little work-table. His big hands were
clenched; one saw now the fire of his eyes under
the shadow of his brows. He was trying to get his
breath. His eyes went from the woman he had
trusted to the friend he had trusted, and then back
to the woman.</p>

<p>By this time and for the moment all three half
understood one another. Yet none dared say a
word to ease the pent-up things that choked
them.</p>

<p>It was the husband&rsquo;s voice that broke the silence
at last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wanted to see me?&rdquo; he said to Raut.</p>

<p>Raut started as he spoke. &ldquo;I came to see you,&rdquo;
he said, resolved to lie to the last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Horrocks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You promised,&rdquo; said Raut, &ldquo;to show me some
fine effects of moonlight and smoke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I promised to show you some fine effects of
moonlight and smoke,&rdquo; repeated Horrocks in a
colourless voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I thought I might catch you to-night
before you went down to the works,&rdquo; proceeded
Raut, &ldquo;and come with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was another pause. Did the man mean to
take the thing coolly? Did he after all know?
How long had he been in the room? Yet even at
the moment when they heard the door, their attitudes....
Horrocks glanced at the profile of the
woman, shadowy pallid in the half-light. Then he
glanced at Raut, and seemed to recover himself
suddenly. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I promised to
show you the works under their proper dramatic
conditions. It&rsquo;s odd how I could have forgotten.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I am troubling you&rdquo;&mdash;began Raut.</p>

<p>Horrocks started again. A new light had suddenly
come into the sultry gloom of his eyes. &ldquo;Not
in the least,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you been telling Mr. Raut of all these
contrasts of flame and shadow you think so splendid?&rdquo;
said the woman, turning now to her husband
for the first time, her confidence creeping back again,
her voice just one half-note too high. &ldquo;That dreadful
theory of yours that machinery is beautiful, and
everything else in the world ugly. I thought he
would not spare you, Mr. Raut. It&rsquo;s his great
theory, his one discovery in art.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am slow to make discoveries,&rdquo; said Horrocks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
grimly, damping her suddenly. &ldquo;But what I discover....&rdquo;
He stopped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing;&rdquo; and suddenly he rose to his feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I promised to show you the works,&rdquo; he said to
Raut, and put his big, clumsy hand on his friend&rsquo;s
shoulder. &ldquo;And you are ready to go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite,&rdquo; said Raut, and stood up also.</p>

<p>There was another pause. Each of them peered
through the indistinctness of the dusk at the other
two. Horrock&rsquo;s hand still rested on Raut&rsquo;s shoulder.
Raut half fancied still that the incident was trivial
after all. But Mrs. Horrocks knew her husband
better, knew that grim quiet in his voice, and the
confusion in her mind took a vague shape of physical
evil. &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Horrocks, and, dropping
his hand, turned towards the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My hat?&rdquo; Raut looked round in the half-light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my work-basket,&rdquo; said Mrs. Horrocks,
with a gust of hysterical laughter. Their hands
came together on the back of the chair. &ldquo;Here it
is!&rdquo; he said. She had an impulse to warn him in
an undertone, but she could not frame a word.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Beware of him!&rdquo; struggled in
her mind, and the swift moment passed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Got it?&rdquo; said Horrocks, standing with the door
half open.</p>

<p>Raut stepped towards him. &ldquo;Better say good-bye
to Mrs. Horrocks,&rdquo; said the ironmaster, even
more grimly quiet in his tone than before.</p>

<p>Raut started and turned. &ldquo;Good-evening, Mrs.
Horrocks,&rdquo; he said, and their hands touched.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>Horrocks held the door open with a ceremonial
politeness unusual in him towards men. Raut went
out, and then, after a wordless look at her, her
husband followed. She stood motionless while
Raut&rsquo;s light footfall and her husband&rsquo;s heavy tread,
like bass and treble, passed down the passage
together. The front door slammed heavily. She
went to the window, moving slowly, and stood
watching&mdash;leaning forward. The two men appeared
for a moment at the gateway in the road, passed
under the street lamp, and were hidden by the
black masses of the shrubbery. The lamplight fell
for a moment on their faces, showing only unmeaning
pale patches, telling nothing of what she still feared,
and doubted, and craved vainly to know. Then
she sank down into a crouching attitude in the big
arm-chair, her eyes wide open and staring out at
the red lights from the furnaces that flickered in
the sky. An hour after she was still there, her
attitude scarcely changed.</p>

<p>The oppressive stillness of the evening weighed
heavily upon Raut. They went side by side down
the road in silence, and in silence turned into the
cinder-made by-way that presently opened out the
prospect of the valley.</p>

<p>A blue haze, half dust, half mist, touched the
long valley with mystery. Beyond were Hanley
and Etruria, grey and dark masses, outlined thinly
by the rare golden dots of the street lamps, and
here and there a gaslit window, or the yellow glare
of some late-working factory or crowded public-house.
Out of the masses, clear and slender against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
the evening sky, rose a multitude of tall chimneys,
many of them reeking, a few smokeless during a
season of &ldquo;play.&rdquo; Here and there a pallid patch
and ghostly stunted beehive shapes showed the
position of a pot-bank, or a wheel, black and sharp
against the hot lower sky, marked some colliery
where they raise the iridescent coal of the place.
Nearer at hand was the broad stretch of railway,
and half invisible trains shunted&mdash;a steady puffing
and rumbling, with every run a ringing concussion
and a rhythmic series of impacts, and a passage of
intermittent puffs of white steam across the further
view. And to the left, between the railway and the
dark mass of the low hill beyond, dominating the
whole view, colossal, inky-black, and crowned with
smoke and fitful flames, stood the great cylinders of
the Jeddah Company Blast Furnaces, the central
edifices of the big ironworks of which Horrocks was
the manager. They stood heavy and threatening, full
of an incessant turmoil of flames and seething molten
iron, and about the feet of them rattled the rolling-mills,
and the steam-hammer beat heavily and
splashed the white iron sparks hither and thither.
Even as they looked, a truckful of fuel was shot
into one of the giants, and the red flames gleamed
out, and a confusion of smoke and black dust came
boiling upwards towards the sky.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly you get some fine effects of colour
with your furnaces,&rdquo; said Raut, breaking a silence
that had become apprehensive.</p>

<p>Horrocks grunted. He stood with his hands in
his pockets, frowning down at the dim steaming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
railway and the busy ironworks beyond, frowning
as if he were thinking out some knotty problem.</p>

<p>Raut glanced at him and away again. &ldquo;At
present your moonlight effect is hardly ripe,&rdquo; he
continued, looking upward; &ldquo;the moon is still
smothered by the vestiges of daylight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Horrocks stared at him with the expression of
a man who has suddenly awakened. &ldquo;Vestiges of
daylight?... Of course, of course.&rdquo; He too looked
up at the moon, pale still in the midsummer sky.
&ldquo;Come along,&rdquo; he said suddenly, and, gripping Raut&rsquo;s
arm in his hand, made a move towards the path that
dropped from them to the railway.</p>

<p>Raut hung back. Their eyes met and saw a
thousand things in a moment that their lips came
near to say. Horrocks&rsquo;s hand tightened and then
relaxed. He let go, and before Raut was aware of it,
they were arm in arm, and walking, one unwillingly
enough, down the path.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see the fine effect of the railway signals
towards Burslem,&rdquo; said Horrocks, suddenly breaking
into loquacity, striding fast and tightening the grip
of his elbow the while. &ldquo;Little green lights and
red and white lights, all against the haze. You
have an eye for effect, Raut. It&rsquo;s a fine effect.
And look at those furnaces of mine, how they rise
upon us as we come down the hill. That to the
right is my pet&mdash;seventy feet of him. I packed him
myself, and he&rsquo;s boiled away cheerfully with iron in
his guts for five long years. I&rsquo;ve a particular fancy
for <em>him</em>. That line of red there&mdash;a lovely bit of
warm orange you&rsquo;d call it, Raut&mdash;that&rsquo;s the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
puddlers&rsquo; furnaces, and there, in the hot light, three
black figures&mdash;did you see the white splash of the
steam-hammer then?&mdash;that&rsquo;s the rolling-mills. Come
along! Clang, clatter, how it goes rattling across
the floor! Sheet tin, Raut,&mdash;amazing stuff. Glass
mirrors are not in it when that stuff comes from the
mill. And, squelch!&mdash;there goes the hammer again.
Come along!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had to stop talking to catch at his breath.
His arm twisted into Raut&rsquo;s with benumbing tightness.
He had come striding down the black path
towards the railway as though he was possessed.
Raut had not spoken a word, had simply hung
back against Horrocks&rsquo;s pull with all his strength.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; he said now, laughing nervously, but
with an undernote of snarl in his voice, &ldquo;why on
earth are you nipping my arm off, Horrocks, and
dragging me along like this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>At length Horrocks released him. His manner
changed again. &ldquo;Nipping your arm off?&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Sorry. But it&rsquo;s you taught me the trick of walking
in that friendly way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t learnt the refinements of it yet
then,&rdquo; said Raut, laughing artificially again. &ldquo;By
Jove! I&rsquo;m black and blue.&rdquo; Horrocks offered no
apology. They stood now near the bottom of the
hill, close to the fence that bordered the railway.
The ironworks had grown larger and spread out
with their approach. They looked up to the blast
furnaces now instead of down; the further view of
Etruria and Hanley had dropped out of sight with
their descent. Before them, by the stile, rose a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
notice-board, bearing, still dimly visible, the words,
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Beware of the trains</span>,&rdquo; half hidden by splashes
of coaly mud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fine effects,&rdquo; said Horrocks, waving his arm.
&ldquo;Here comes a train. The puffs of smoke, the
orange glare, the round eye of light in front of it,
the melodious rattle. Fine effects! But these
furnaces of mine used to be finer, before we shoved
cones in their throats, and saved the gas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; said Raut. &ldquo;Cones?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cones, my man, cones. I&rsquo;ll show you one
nearer. The flames used to flare out of the open
throats, great&mdash;what is it?&mdash;pillars of cloud by day,
red and black smoke, and pillars of fire by night.
Now we run it off in pipes, and burn it to heat the
blast, and the top is shut by a cone. You&rsquo;ll be
interested in that cone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But every now and then,&rdquo; said Raut, &ldquo;you get
a burst of fire and smoke up there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The cone&rsquo;s not fixed, it&rsquo;s hung by a chain from
a lever, and balanced by an equipoise. You shall
see it nearer. Else, of course, there&rsquo;d be no way of
getting fuel into the thing. Every now and then
the cone dips, and out comes the flare.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Raut. He looked over his shoulder.
&ldquo;The moon gets brighter,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come along,&rdquo; said Horrocks abruptly, gripping
his shoulder again, and moving him suddenly towards
the railway crossing. And then came one of those
swift incidents, vivid, but so rapid that they leave
one doubtful and reeling. Halfway across, Horrocks&rsquo;s
hand suddenly clenched upon him like a vice and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
swung him backward and through a half-turn, so that
he looked up the line. And there a chain of lamp-lit
carriage-windows telescoped swiftly as it came
towards them, and the red and yellow lights of an
engine grew larger and larger, rushing down upon
them. As he grasped what this meant, he turned
his face to Horrocks, and pushed with all his strength
against the arm that held him back between the
rails. The struggle did not last a moment. Just
as certain as it was that Horrocks held him there,
so certain was it that he had been violently lugged
out of danger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Out of the way,&rdquo; said Horrocks, with a gasp, as
the train came rattling by, and they stood panting
by the gate into the ironworks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not see it coming,&rdquo; said Raut, still, even
in spite of his own apprehensions, trying to keep up
an appearance of ordinary intercourse.</p>

<p>Horrocks answered with a grunt. &ldquo;The cone,&rdquo;
he said, and then, as one who recovers himself,
&ldquo;I thought you did not hear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Raut.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have had you run over then for
the world,&rdquo; said Horrocks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For a moment I lost my nerve,&rdquo; said Raut.</p>

<p>Horrocks stood for half a minute, then turned
abruptly towards the ironworks again. &ldquo;See how
fine these great mounds of mine, these clinker-heaps,
look in the night! That truck yonder, up above
there! Up it goes, and out-tilts the slag. See the
palpitating red stuff go sliding down the slope. As
we get nearer, the heap rises up and cuts the blast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
furnaces. See the quiver up above the big one.
Not that way! This way, between the heaps. That
goes to the puddling furnaces, but I want to show
you the canal first.&rdquo; He came and took Raut by the
elbow, and so they went along side by side. Raut
answered Horrocks vaguely. What, he asked himself,
had really happened on the line? Was he deluding
himself with his own fancies, or had Horrocks actually
held him back in the way of the train? Had he
just been within an ace of being murdered?</p>

<p>Suppose this slouching, scowling monster <em>did</em>
know anything? For a minute or two then Raut
was really afraid for his life, but the mood passed
as he reasoned with himself. After all, Horrocks
might have heard nothing. At anyrate, he had
pulled him out of the way in time. His odd manner
might be due to the mere vague jealousy he had
shown once before. He was talking now of the
ash-heaps and the canal. &ldquo;Eigh?&rdquo; said Horrocks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; said Raut. &ldquo;Rather! The haze in
the moonlight. Fine!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our canal,&rdquo; said Horrocks, stopping suddenly.
&ldquo;Our canal by moonlight and firelight is an immense
effect. You&rsquo;ve never seen it? Fancy that!
You&rsquo;ve spent too many of your evenings philandering
up in Newcastle there. I tell you, for real florid
effects&mdash; But you shall see. Boiling water....&rdquo;</p>

<p>As they came out of the labyrinth of clinker-heaps
and mounds of coal and ore, the noises of the rolling-mill
sprang upon them suddenly, loud, near, and
distinct. Three shadowy workmen went by and
touched their caps to Horrocks. Their faces were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
vague in the darkness. Raut felt a futile impulse
to address them, and before he could frame his words,
they passed into the shadows. Horrocks pointed
to the canal close before them now: a weird-looking
place it seemed, in the blood-red reflections of the
furnaces. The hot water that cooled the tuyères
came into it, some fifty yards up&mdash;a tumultuous,
almost boiling affluent, and the steam rose up from
the water in silent white wisps and streaks, wrapping
damply about them, an incessant succession of ghosts
coming up from the black and red eddies, a white
uprising that made the head swim. The shining
black tower of the larger blast-furnace rose overhead
out of the mist, and its tumultuous riot filled their
ears. Raut kept away from the edge of the water,
and watched Horrocks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here it is red,&rdquo; said Horrocks, &ldquo;blood-red vapour
as red and hot as sin; but yonder there, where
the moonlight falls on it, and it drives across the
clinker-heaps, it is as white as death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Raut turned his head for a moment, and then
came back hastily to his watch on Horrocks.
&ldquo;Come along to the rolling-mills,&rdquo; said Horrocks.
The threatening hold was not so evident that time,
and Raut felt a little reassured. But all the same,
what on earth did Horrocks mean about &ldquo;white as
death&rdquo; and &ldquo;red as sin&rdquo;? Coincidence, perhaps?</p>

<p>They went and stood behind the puddlers for a
little while, and then through the rolling-mills, where
amidst an incessant din the deliberate steam-hammer
beat the juice out of the succulent iron, and black,
half-naked Titans rushed the plastic bars, like hot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
sealing-wax, between the wheels. &ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; said
Horrocks in Raut&rsquo;s ear, and they went and peeped
through the little glass hole behind the tuyères, and
saw the tumbled fire writhing in the pit of the blast-furnace.
It left one eye blinded for a while. Then,
with green and blue patches dancing across the dark,
they went to the lift by which the trucks of ore
and fuel and lime were raised to the top of the
big cylinder.</p>

<p>And out upon the narrow rail that overhung the
furnace, Raut&rsquo;s doubts came upon him again. Was
it wise to be here? If Horrocks did know&mdash;everything!
Do what he would, he could not resist a
violent trembling. Right under foot was a sheer
depth of seventy feet. It was a dangerous place.
They pushed by a truck of fuel to get to the railing
that crowned the place. The reek of the furnace,
a sulphurous vapour streaked with pungent bitterness,
seemed to make the distant hillside of Hanley
quiver. The moon was riding out now from among
a drift of clouds, half-way up the sky above the undulating
wooded outlines of Newcastle. The steaming
canal ran away from below them under an
indistinct bridge, and vanished into the dim haze
of the flat fields towards Burslem.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the cone I&rsquo;ve been telling you of,&rdquo; shouted
Horrocks; &ldquo;and, below that, sixty feet of fire and
molten metal, with the air of the blast frothing
through it like gas in soda-water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Raut gripped the hand-rail tightly, and stared
down at the cone. The heat was intense. The
boiling of the iron and the tumult of the blast made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
a thunderous accompaniment to Horrocks&rsquo;s voice.
But the thing had to be gone through now. Perhaps,
after all....</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the middle,&rdquo; bawled Horrocks, &ldquo;temperature
near a thousand degrees. If <em>you</em> were dropped into
it ... flash into flame like a pinch of gunpowder
in a candle. Put your hand out and feel the heat
of his breath. Why, even up here I&rsquo;ve seen the
rain-water boiling off the trucks. And that cone
there. It&rsquo;s a damned sight too hot for roasting
cakes. The top side of it&rsquo;s three hundred degrees.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three hundred degrees!&rdquo; said Raut.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three hundred centigrade, mind!&rdquo; said Horrocks.
&ldquo;It will boil the blood out of you in no time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eigh?&rdquo; said Raut, and turned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boil the blood out of you in.... No, you
don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me go!&rdquo; screamed Raut. &ldquo;Let go my
arm!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With one hand he clutched at the hand-rail, then
with both. For a moment the two men stood swaying.
Then suddenly, with a violent jerk, Horrocks
had twisted him from his hold. He clutched at
Horrocks and missed, his foot went back into empty
air; in mid-air he twisted himself, and then cheek
and shoulder and knee struck the hot cone together.</p>

<p>He clutched the chain by which the cone hung,
and the thing sank an infinitesimal amount as he
struck it. A circle of glowing red appeared about
him, and a tongue of flame, released from the chaos
within, flickered up towards him. An intense pain
assailed him at the knees, and he could smell the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
singeing of his hands. He raised himself to his
feet, and tried to climb up the chain, and then
something struck his head. Black and shining with
the moonlight, the throat of the furnace rose about him.</p>

<p>Horrocks, he saw, stood above him by one of the
trucks of fuel on the rail. The gesticulating figure
was bright and white in the moonlight, and shouting,
&ldquo;Fizzle, you fool! Fizzle, you hunter of women!
You hot-blooded hound! Boil! boil! boil!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly he caught up a handful of coal out of
the truck, and flung it deliberately, lump after lump,
at Raut.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Horrocks!&rdquo; cried Raut. &ldquo;Horrocks!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He clung crying to the chain, pulling himself up
from the burning of the cone. Each missile Horrocks
flung hit him. His clothes charred and glowed, and
as he struggled the cone dropped, and a rush of hot
suffocating gas whooped out and burned round him
in a swift breath of flame.</p>

<p>His human likeness departed from him. When
the momentary red had passed, Horrocks saw a
charred, blackened figure, its head streaked with
blood, still clutching and fumbling with the chain,
and writhing in agony&mdash;a cindery animal, an inhuman,
monstrous creature that began a sobbing
intermittent shriek.</p>

<p>Abruptly, at the sight, the ironmaster&rsquo;s anger
passed. A deadly sickness came upon him. The
heavy odour of burning flesh came drifting up to his
nostrils. His sanity returned to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;God have mercy upon me!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;O
God! what have I done?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>He knew the thing below him, save that it still
moved and felt, was already a dead man&mdash;that the
blood of the poor wretch must be boiling in his
veins. An intense realisation of that agony came
to his mind, and overcame every other feeling. For
a moment he stood irresolute, and then, turning to
the truck, he hastily tilted its contents upon the
struggling thing that had once been a man. The
mass fell with a thud, and went radiating over the
cone. With the thud the shriek ended, and a
boiling confusion of smoke, dust, and flame came
rushing up towards him. As it passed, he saw the
cone clear again.</p>

<p>Then he staggered back, and stood trembling,
clinging to the rail with both hands. His lips
moved, but no words came to them.</p>

<p>Down below was the sound of voices and running
steps. The clangour of rolling in the shed ceased
abruptly.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_PURPLE_PILEUS" id="THE_PURPLE_PILEUS">THE PURPLE PILEUS</a></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Mr. Coombes</span> was sick of life. He walked
away from his unhappy home, and, sick not
only of his own existence, but of everybody
else&rsquo;s, turned aside down Gaswork Lane to avoid the
town, and, crossing the wooden bridge that goes over
the canal to Starling&rsquo;s Cottages, was presently alone
in the damp pinewoods and out of sight and sound
of human habitation. He would stand it no longer.
He repeated aloud with blasphemies unusual to him
that he would stand it no longer.</p>

<p>He was a pale-faced little man, with dark eyes and
a fine and very black moustache. He had a very
stiff, upright collar slightly frayed, that gave him an
illusory double chin, and his overcoat (albeit shabby)
was trimmed with astrachan. His gloves were a bright
brown with black stripes over the knuckles, and split
at the finger ends. His appearance, his wife had said
once in the dear, dead days beyond recall,&mdash;before
he married her, that is,&mdash;was military. But now she
called him&mdash; It seems a dreadful thing to tell of
between husband and wife, but she called him &ldquo;a
little grub.&rdquo; It wasn&rsquo;t the only thing she had called
him, either.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>The row had arisen about that beastly Jennie
again. Jennie was his wife&rsquo;s friend, and, by no
invitation of Mr. Coombes, she came in every blessed
Sunday to dinner, and made a shindy all the afternoon.
She was a big, noisy girl, with a taste for
loud colours and a strident laugh; and this Sunday
she had outdone all her previous intrusions by bringing
in a fellow with her, a chap as showy as herself.
And Mr. Coombes, in a starchy, clean collar and his
Sunday frock-coat, had sat dumb and wrathful at his
own table, while his wife and her guests talked foolishly
and undesirably, and laughed aloud. Well, he
stood that, and after dinner (which, &ldquo;as usual,&rdquo; was
late), what must Miss Jennie do but go to the piano
and play banjo tunes, for all the world as if it were a
week-day! Flesh and blood could not endure such
goings on. They would hear next door, they would
hear in the road, it was a public announcement of their
disrepute. He had to speak.</p>

<p>He had felt himself go pale, and a kind of rigour
had affected his respiration as he delivered himself.
He had been sitting on one of the chairs by the
window&mdash;the new guest had taken possession of the
arm-chair. He turned his head. &ldquo;Sun Day!&rdquo; he
said over the collar, in the voice of one who warns.
&ldquo;Sun Day!&rdquo; What people call a &ldquo;nasty&rdquo; tone
it was.</p>

<p>Jennie had kept on playing, but his wife, who was
looking through some music that was piled on the
top of the piano, had stared at him. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong
now?&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;can&rsquo;t people enjoy themselves?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind rational &rsquo;njoyment, at all,&rdquo; said little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
Coombes, &ldquo;but I ain&rsquo;t a-going to have week-day tunes
playing on a Sunday in this house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with my playing now?&rdquo; said Jennie,
stopping and twirling round on the music-stool with
a monstrous rustle of flounces.</p>

<p>Coombes saw it was going to be a row, and opened
too vigorously, as is common with your timid, nervous
men all the world over. &ldquo;Steady on with that music-stool!&rdquo;
said he; &ldquo;it ain&rsquo;t made for &rsquo;eavy weights.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never you mind about weights,&rdquo; said Jennie,
incensed. &ldquo;What was you saying behind my back
about my playing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely you don&rsquo;t &rsquo;old with not having a bit of
music on a Sunday, Mr. Coombes?&rdquo; said the new
guest, leaning back in the arm-chair, blowing a cloud
of cigarette smoke and smiling in a kind of pitying
way. And simultaneously his wife said something to
Jennie about &ldquo;Never mind &rsquo;im. You go on, Jinny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said Mr. Coombes, addressing the new guest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I arst why?&rdquo; said the new guest, evidently
enjoying both his cigarette and the prospect of an
argument. He was, by the bye, a lank young man,
very stylishly dressed in bright drab, with a white
cravat and a pearl and silver pin. It had been
better taste to come in a black coat, Mr. Coombes
thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; began Mr. Coombes, &ldquo;it don&rsquo;t suit me.
I&rsquo;m a business man. I &rsquo;ave to study my connection.
Rational &rsquo;njoyment&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His connection!&rdquo; said Mrs. Coombes scornfully.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s always a-saying. We got to do
this, and we got to do that&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mean to study my connection,&rdquo; said
Mr. Coombes, &ldquo;what did you marry me for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said Jennie, and turned back to the
piano.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never saw such a man as you,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Coombes. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve altered all round since we were
married. Before&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>Then Jennie began at the tum, tum, tum again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; said Mr. Coombes, driven at last to
revolt, standing up and raising his voice. &ldquo;I tell you
I won&rsquo;t have that.&rdquo; The frock-coat heaved with his
indignation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No vi&rsquo;lence, now,&rdquo; said the long young man in
drab, sitting up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who the juice are you?&rdquo; said Mr. Coombes
fiercely.</p>

<p>Whereupon they all began talking at once. The
new guest said he was Jennie&rsquo;s &ldquo;intended,&rdquo; and
meant to protect her, and Mr. Coombes said he was
welcome to do so anywhere but in his (Mr. Coombes&rsquo;)
house; and Mrs. Coombes said he ought to be
ashamed of insulting his guests, and (as I have
already mentioned) that he was getting a regular
little grub; and the end was, that Mr. Coombes
ordered his visitors out of the house, and they
wouldn&rsquo;t go, and so he said he would go himself.
With his face burning and tears of excitement in
his eyes, he went into the passage, and as he
struggled with his overcoat&mdash;his frock-coat sleeves
got concertinaed up his arm&mdash;and gave a brush at
his silk hat, Jennie began again at the piano, and
strummed him insultingly out of the house. Tum,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
tum, tum. He slammed the shop door so that the
house quivered. That, briefly, was the immediate
making of his mood. You will perhaps begin to
understand his disgust with existence.</p>

<p>As he walked along the muddy path under the firs,&mdash;it
was late October, and the ditches and heaps of
fir needles were gorgeous with clumps of fungi,&mdash;he
recapitulated the melancholy history of his marriage.
It was brief and commonplace enough. He now
perceived with sufficient clearness that his wife had
married him out of a natural curiosity and in order
to escape from her worrying, laborious, and uncertain
life in the workroom; and, like the majority of her
class, she was far too stupid to realise that it was her
duty to co-operate with him in his business. She was
greedy of enjoyment, loquacious, and socially-minded,
and evidently disappointed to find the restraints of
poverty still hanging about her. His worries exasperated
her, and the slightest attempt to control
her proceedings resulted in a charge of &ldquo;grumbling.&rdquo;
Why couldn&rsquo;t he be nice&mdash;as he used to be? And
Coombes was such a harmless little man, too, nourished
mentally on <em>Self-Help</em>, and with a meagre
ambition of self-denial and competition, that was
to end in a &ldquo;sufficiency.&rdquo; Then Jennie came in as
a female Mephistopheles, a gabbling chronicle of
&ldquo;fellers,&rdquo; and was always wanting his wife to go to
theatres, and &ldquo;all that.&rdquo; And in addition were aunts
of his wife, and cousins (male and female), to eat up
capital, insult him personally, upset business arrangements,
annoy good customers, and generally blight his
life. It was not the first occasion by many that Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
Coombes had fled his home in wrath and indignation,
and something like fear, vowing furiously and even
aloud that he wouldn&rsquo;t stand it, and so frothing away
his energy along the line of least resistance. But
never before had he been quite so sick of life as on
this particular Sunday afternoon. The Sunday dinner
may have had its share in his despair&mdash;and the greyness
of the sky. Perhaps, too, he was beginning to
realise his unendurable frustration as a business man
as the consequence of his marriage. Presently bankruptcy,
and after that&mdash; Perhaps she might have
reason to repent when it was too late. And destiny,
as I have already intimated, had planted the path
through the wood with evil-smelling fungi, thickly
and variously planted it, not only on the right side,
but on the left.</p>

<p>A small shopman is in such a melancholy position,
if his wife turns out a disloyal partner. His
capital is all tied up in his business, and to leave
her, means to join the unemployed in some strange
part of the earth. The luxuries of divorce are
beyond him altogether. So that the good old
tradition of marriage for better or worse holds inexorably
for him, and things work up to tragic
culminations. Bricklayers kick their wives to death,
and dukes betray theirs; but it is among the small
clerks and shopkeepers nowadays that it comes
most often to a cutting of throats. Under the circumstances
it is not so very remarkable&mdash;and you
must take it as charitably as you can&mdash;that the mind
of Mr. Coombes ran for a while on some such glorious
close to his disappointed hopes, and that he thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
of razors, pistols, bread-knives, and touching letters
to the coroner denouncing his enemies by name, and
praying piously for forgiveness. After a time his
fierceness gave way to melancholia. He had been
married in this very overcoat, in his first and only
frock-coat that was buttoned up beneath it. He
began to recall their courting along this very walk,
his years of penurious saving to get capital, and the
bright hopefulness of his marrying days. For it all
to work out like this! Was there no sympathetic
ruler anywhere in the world? He reverted to death
as a topic.</p>

<p>He thought of the canal he had just crossed, and
doubted whether he shouldn&rsquo;t stand with his head
out, even in the middle, and it was while drowning
was in his mind that the purple pileus caught his eye.
He looked at it mechanically for a moment, and
stopped and stooped towards it to pick it up, under
the impression that it was some such small leather
object as a purse. Then he saw that it was the
purple top of a fungus, a peculiarly poisonous-looking
purple: slimy, shiny, and emitting a sour odour.
He hesitated with his hand an inch or so from it, and
the thought of poison crossed his mind. With that
he picked the thing, and stood up again with it in his
hand.</p>

<p>The odour was certainly strong&mdash;acrid, but by no
means disgusting. He broke off a piece, and the
fresh surface was a creamy white, that changed like
magic in the space of ten seconds to a yellowish-green
colour. It was even an inviting-looking change.
He broke off two other pieces to see it repeated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
They were wonderful things these fungi, thought Mr.
Coombes, and all of them the deadliest poisons, as his
father had often told him. Deadly poisons!</p>

<p>There is no time like the present for a rash resolve.
Why not here and now? thought Mr. Coombes. He
tasted a little piece, a very little piece indeed&mdash;a
mere crumb. It was so pungent that he almost spat
it out again, then merely hot and full-flavoured. A
kind of German mustard with a touch of horse-radish
and&mdash;well, mushroom. He swallowed it in the excitement
of the moment. Did he like it or did he
not? His mind was curiously careless. He would
try another bit. It really wasn&rsquo;t bad&mdash;it was good.
He forgot his troubles in the interest of the immediate
moment. Playing with death it was. He took
another bite, and then deliberately finished a mouthful.
A curious tingling sensation began in his finger-tips
and toes. His pulse began to move faster. The
blood in his ears sounded like a mill-race. &ldquo;Try bi&rsquo;
more,&rdquo; said Mr. Coombes. He turned and looked
about him, and found his feet unsteady. He saw and
struggled towards a little patch of purple a dozen
yards away. &ldquo;Jol&rsquo; goo&rsquo; stuff,&rdquo; said Mr. Coombes.
&ldquo;E&mdash;lomore ye&rsquo;.&rdquo; He pitched forward and fell on
his face, his hands outstretched towards the cluster of
pilei. But he did not eat any more of them. He
forgot forthwith.</p>

<p>He rolled over and sat up with a look of astonishment
on his face. His carefully brushed silk hat had
rolled away towards the ditch. He pressed his hand
to his brow. Something had happened, but he could
not rightly determine what it was. Anyhow, he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
no longer dull&mdash;he felt bright, cheerful. And his
throat was afire. He laughed in the sudden gaiety
of his heart. Had he been dull? He did not
know; but at anyrate he would be dull no longer.
He got up and stood unsteadily, regarding the
universe with an agreeable smile. He began to
remember. He could not remember very well,
because of a steam roundabout that was beginning
in his head. And he knew he had been disagreeable
at home, just because they wanted to be
happy. They were quite right; life should be as gay
as possible. He would go home and make it up,
and reassure them. And why not take some of this
delightful toadstool with him, for them to eat? A
hatful, no less. Some of those red ones with white
spots as well, and a few yellow. He had been a dull
dog, an enemy to merriment; he would make up for
it. It would be gay to turn his coat-sleeves inside
out, and stick some yellow gorse into his waistcoat
pockets. Then home&mdash;singing&mdash;for a jolly evening.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>After the departure of Mr. Coombes, Jennie discontinued
playing, and turned round on the music-stool
again. &ldquo;What a fuss about nothing,&rdquo; said
Jennie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, Mr. Clarence, what I&rsquo;ve got to put up
with,&rdquo; said Mrs. Coombes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is a bit hasty,&rdquo; said Mr. Clarence judicially.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t got the slightest sense of our position,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Coombes; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what I complain of. He
cares for nothing but his old shop; and if I have a bit
of company, or buy anything to keep myself decent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
or get any little thing I want out of the housekeeping
money, there&rsquo;s disagreeables. &lsquo;Economy,&rsquo; he says;
&lsquo;struggle for life,&rsquo; and all that. He lies awake of
nights about it, worrying how he can screw me out of
a shilling. He wanted us to eat Dorset butter once.
If once I was to give in to him&mdash;there!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Jennie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If a man values a woman,&rdquo; said Mr. Clarence
lounging back in the arm-chair, &ldquo;he must be prepared
to make sacrifices for her. For my own part,&rdquo; said
Mr. Clarence, with his eye on Jennie, &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t
think of marrying till I was in a position to do the
thing in style. It&rsquo;s downright selfishness. A man
ought to go through the rough-and-tumble by himself,
and not drag her&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t agree altogether with that,&rdquo; said Jennie.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why a man shouldn&rsquo;t have a woman&rsquo;s
help, provided he doesn&rsquo;t treat her meanly, you know.
It&rsquo;s meanness&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t believe,&rdquo; said Mrs. Coombes. &ldquo;But
I was a fool to &rsquo;ave &rsquo;im. I might &rsquo;ave known. If it
&rsquo;adn&rsquo;t been for my father, we shouldn&rsquo;t have had not a
carriage to our wedding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord! he didn&rsquo;t stick out at that?&rdquo; said Mr.
Clarence, quite shocked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Said he wanted the money for his stock, or some
such rubbish. Why, he wouldn&rsquo;t have a woman in
to help me once a week if it wasn&rsquo;t for my standing
out plucky. And the fusses he makes about money&mdash;comes
to me, well, pretty near crying, with sheets
of paper and figgers. &lsquo;If only we can tide over this
year,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;the business is bound to go.&rsquo; &lsquo;If only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
we can tide over this year,&rsquo; I says; &lsquo;then it&rsquo;ll be, if
only we can tide over next year. I know you,&rsquo; I says.
&lsquo;And you don&rsquo;t catch me screwing myself lean and
ugly. Why didn&rsquo;t you marry a slavey?&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;if
you wanted one&mdash;instead of a respectable girl,&rsquo; I
says.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Mrs. Coombes. But we will not follow this
unedifying conversation further. Suffice it that Mr.
Coombes was very satisfactorily disposed of, and they
had a snug little time round the fire. Then Mrs.
Coombes went to get the tea, and Jennie sat coquettishly
on the arm of Mr. Clarence&rsquo;s chair until the
tea-things clattered outside. &ldquo;What was that I
heard?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Coombes playfully, as she
entered, and there was badinage about kissing.
They were just sitting down to the little circular
table when the first intimation of Mr. Coombes&rsquo;
return was heard.</p>

<p>This was a fumbling at the latch of the front door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ere&rsquo;s my lord,&rdquo; said Mrs. Coombes. &ldquo;Went out
like a lion and comes back like a lamb, I&rsquo;ll lay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Something fell over in the shop: a chair, it sounded
like. Then there was a sound as of some complicated
step exercise in the passage. Then the door opened
and Coombes appeared. But it was Coombes transfigured.
The immaculate collar had been torn carelessly
from his throat. His carefully-brushed silk hat,
half-full of a crush of fungi, was under one arm; his
coat was inside out, and his waistcoat adorned with
bunches of yellow-blossomed furze. These little
eccentricities of Sunday costume, however, were quite
overshadowed by the change in his face; it was livid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
white, his eyes were unnaturally large and bright,
and his pale blue lips were drawn back in a cheerless
grin. &ldquo;Merry!&rdquo; he said. He had stopped dancing
to open the door. &ldquo;Rational &rsquo;njoyment. Dance.&rdquo;
He made three fantastic steps into the room, and
stood bowing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jim!&rdquo; shrieked Mrs. Coombes, and Mr. Clarence
sat petrified, with a dropping lower jaw.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tea,&rdquo; said Mr. Coombes. &ldquo;Jol&rsquo; thing, tea. Tose-stools,
too. Brosher.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s drunk,&rdquo; said Jennie in a weak voice. Never
before had she seen this intense pallor in a drunken
man, or such shining, dilated eyes.</p>

<p>Mr. Coombes held out a handful of scarlet agaric
to Mr. Clarence. &ldquo;Jo&rsquo; stuff,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;ta&rsquo; some.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that moment he was genial. Then at the sight
of their startled faces he changed, with the swift
transition of insanity, into overbearing fury. And it
seemed as if he had suddenly recalled the quarrel of
his departure. In such a huge voice as Mrs. Coombes
had never heard before, he shouted, &ldquo;My house. I&rsquo;m
master &rsquo;ere. Eat what I give yer!&rdquo; He bawled this,
as it seemed, without an effort, without a violent
gesture, standing there as motionless as one who
whispers, holding out a handful of fungus.</p>

<p>Clarence approved himself a coward. He could
not meet the mad fury in Coombes&rsquo; eyes; he rose to
his feet, pushing back his chair, and turned, stooping.
At that Coombes rushed at him. Jennie saw her
opportunity, and, with the ghost of a shriek, made
for the door. Mrs. Coombes followed her. Clarence
tried to dodge. Over went the tea-table with a smash<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
as Coombes clutched him by the collar and tried to
thrust the fungus into his mouth. Clarence was
content to leave his collar behind him, and shot out
into the passage with red patches of fly agaric still
adherent to his face. &ldquo;Shut &rsquo;im in!&rdquo; cried Mrs.
Coombes, and would have closed the door, but her
supports deserted her; Jennie saw the shop door
open, and vanished thereby, locking it behind her,
while Clarence went on hastily into the kitchen.
Mr. Coombes came heavily against the door, and
Mrs. Coombes, finding the key was inside, fled
upstairs and locked herself in the spare bedroom.</p>

<p>So the new convert to <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">joie de vivre</i> emerged upon
the passage, his decorations a little scattered, but that
respectable hatful of fungi still under his arm. He
hesitated at the three ways, and decided on the
kitchen. Whereupon Clarence, who was fumbling
with the key, gave up the attempt to imprison his
host, and fled into the scullery, only to be captured
before he could open the door into the yard. Mr.
Clarence is singularly reticent of the details of what
occurred. It seems that Mr. Coombes&rsquo; transitory
irritation had vanished again, and he was once more
a genial playfellow. And as there were knives and
meat choppers about, Clarence very generously
resolved to humour him and so avoid anything tragic.
It is beyond dispute that Mr. Coombes played with
Mr. Clarence to his heart&rsquo;s content; they could not
have been more playful and familiar if they had
known each other for years. He insisted gaily on
Clarence trying the fungi, and after a friendly tussle,
was smitten with remorse at the mess he was making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
of his guest&rsquo;s face. It also appears that Clarence was
dragged under the sink and his face scrubbed with
the blacking brush,&mdash;he being still resolved to humour
the lunatic at any cost,&mdash;and that finally, in a somewhat
dishevelled, chipped, and discoloured condition,
he was assisted to his coat and shown out by the
back door, the shopway being barred by Jennie.
Mr. Coombes&rsquo; wandering thoughts then turned to
Jennie. Jennie had been unable to unfasten the shop
door, but she shot the bolts against Mr. Coombes&rsquo;
latch-key, and remained in possession of the shop for
the rest of the evening.</p>

<p>It would appear that Mr. Coombes then returned
to the kitchen, still in pursuit of gaiety, and, albeit a
strict Good Templar, drank (or spilt down the front
of the first and only frock-coat) no less than five
bottles of the stout Mrs. Coombes insisted upon
having for her health&rsquo;s sake. He made cheerful
noises by breaking off the necks of the bottles with
several of his wife&rsquo;s wedding-present dinner-plates,
and during the earlier part of this great drunk he
sang divers merry ballads. He cut his finger rather
badly with one of the bottles,&mdash;the only bloodshed in
this story,&mdash;and what with that, and the systematic
convulsion of his inexperienced physiology by the
liquorish brand of Mrs. Coombes&rsquo; stout, it may be the
evil of the fungus poison was somehow allayed. But
we prefer to draw a veil over the concluding incidents
of this Sunday afternoon. They ended in the coal
cellar, in a deep and healing sleep.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>An interval of five years elapsed. Again it was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
Sunday afternoon in October, and again Mr. Coombes
walked through the pinewood beyond the canal.
He was still the same dark-eyed, black-moustached
little man that he was at the outset of the story, but
his double chin was now scarcely so illusory as it had
been. His overcoat was new, with a velvet lapel,
and a stylish collar with turn-down corners, free of
any coarse starchiness, had replaced the original all-round
article. His hat was glossy, his gloves newish&mdash;though
one finger had split and been carefully
mended. And a casual observer would have noticed
about him a certain rectitude of bearing, a certain
erectness of head that marks the man who thinks
well of himself. He was a master now, with three
assistants. Beside him walked a larger sunburnt
parody of himself, his brother Tom, just back from
Australia. They were recapitulating their early
struggles, and Mr. Coombes had just been making
a financial statement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very nice little business, Jim,&rdquo; said brother
Tom. &ldquo;In these days of competition you&rsquo;re jolly
lucky to have worked it up so. And you&rsquo;re jolly
lucky, too, to have a wife who&rsquo;s willing to help like
yours does.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Between ourselves,&rdquo; said Mr. Coombes, &ldquo;it wasn&rsquo;t
always so. It wasn&rsquo;t always like this. To begin
with, the missus was a bit giddy. Girls are funny
creatures.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. You&rsquo;d hardly think it, but she was downright
extravagant, and always having slaps at me.
I was a bit too easy and loving, and all that, and she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
thought the whole blessed show was run for her.
Turned the &rsquo;ouse into a regular caravansery, always
having her relations and girls from business in, and
their chaps. Comic songs a&rsquo; Sunday, it was getting
to, and driving trade away. And she was making
eyes at the chaps, too! I tell you, Tom, the place
wasn&rsquo;t my own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;a&rsquo; thought it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was so. Well&mdash;I reasoned with her. I said,
&lsquo;I ain&rsquo;t a duke, to keep a wife like a pet animal. I
married you for &rsquo;elp and company.&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;You got
to &rsquo;elp and pull the business through.&rsquo; She wouldn&rsquo;t
&rsquo;ear of it. &lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; I says; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m a mild man till
I&rsquo;m roused,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;and it&rsquo;s getting to that.&rsquo; But she
wouldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;ear of no warnings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the way with women. She didn&rsquo;t think I &rsquo;ad
it in me to be roused. Women of her sort (between
ourselves, Tom) don&rsquo;t respect a man until they&rsquo;re a
bit afraid of him. So I just broke out to show her.
In comes a girl named Jennie, that used to work with
her, and her chap. We &rsquo;ad a bit of a row, and I
came out &rsquo;ere&mdash;it was just such another day as this&mdash;and
I thought it all out. Then I went back and
pitched into them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did. I was mad, I can tell you. I wasn&rsquo;t going
to &rsquo;it &rsquo;er, if I could &rsquo;elp it, so I went back and licked
into this chap, just to show &rsquo;er what I could do.
&rsquo;E was a big chap, too. Well, I chucked him, and
smashed things about, and gave &rsquo;er a scaring, and she
ran up and locked &rsquo;erself into the spare room.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all. I says to &rsquo;er the next morning, &lsquo;Now
you know,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;what I&rsquo;m like when I&rsquo;m roused.&rsquo;
And I didn&rsquo;t &rsquo;ave to say anything more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve been happy ever after, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So to speak. There&rsquo;s nothing like putting your
foot down with them. If it &rsquo;adn&rsquo;t been for that afternoon
I should &rsquo;a&rsquo; been tramping the roads now, and
she&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; been grumbling at me, and all her family
grumbling for bringing her to poverty&mdash;I know their
little ways. But we&rsquo;re all right now. And it&rsquo;s a very
decent little business, as you say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They proceed on their way meditatively. &ldquo;Women
are funny creatures,&rdquo; said brother Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They want a firm hand,&rdquo; says Coombes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a lot of these funguses there are about
here!&rdquo; remarked brother Tom presently. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see
what use they are in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Coombes looked. &ldquo;I dessay they&rsquo;re sent for
some wise purpose,&rdquo; said Mr. Coombes.</p>

<p>And that was as much thanks as the purple pileus
ever got for maddening this absurd little man to the
pitch of decisive action, and so altering the whole
course of his life.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_JILTING_OF_JANE" id="THE_JILTING_OF_JANE">THE JILTING OF JANE</a></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">As</span> I sit writing in my study, I can hear our Jane
bumping her way downstairs with a brush and
dustpan. She used in the old days to sing hymn
tunes, or the British national song for the time being,
to these instruments, but latterly she has been silent
and even careful over her work. Time was when I
prayed with fervour for such silence, and my wife with
sighs for such care, but now they have come we are
not so glad as we might have anticipated we should
be. Indeed, I would rejoice secretly, though it may
be unmanly weakness to admit it, even to hear Jane
sing &ldquo;Daisy,&rdquo; or by the fracture of any plate but one
of Euphemia&rsquo;s best green ones, to learn that the
period of brooding has come to an end.</p>

<p>Yet how we longed to hear the last of Jane&rsquo;s young
man before we heard the last of him! Jane was
always very free with her conversation to my wife,
and discoursed admirably in the kitchen on a variety
of topics&mdash;so well, indeed, that I sometimes left my
study door open&mdash;our house is a small one&mdash;to partake
of it. But after William came, it was always
William, nothing but William; William this and
William that; and when we thought William was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
worked out and exhausted altogether, then William
all over again. The engagement lasted altogether
three years; yet how she got introduced to William,
and so became thus saturated with him, was always a
secret. For my part, I believe it was at the street
corner where the Rev. Barnabas Baux used to hold
an open-air service after evensong on Sundays.
Young Cupids were wont to flit like moths round
the paraffin flare of that centre of High Church
hymn-singing. I fancy she stood singing hymns
there, out of memory and her imagination, instead of
coming home to get supper, and William came up
beside her and said, &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; &ldquo;Hello yourself!&rdquo; she
said; and, etiquette being satisfied, they proceeded to
talk together.</p>

<p>As Euphemia has a reprehensible way of letting
her servants talk to her, she soon heard of him.
&ldquo;He is <em>such</em> a respectable young man, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said
Jane, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Ignoring the slur cast on
her acquaintance, my wife inquired further about this
William.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is second porter at Maynard&rsquo;s, the draper&rsquo;s,&rdquo;
said Jane, &ldquo;and gets eighteen shillings&mdash;nearly a pound&mdash;a
week, m&rsquo;m; and when the head porter leaves he
will be head porter. His relatives are quite superior
people, m&rsquo;m. Not labouring people at all. His
father was a greengrosher, m&rsquo;m, and had a chumor,
and he was bankrup&rsquo; twice. And one of his sisters is
in a Home for the Dying. It will be a very good
match for me, m&rsquo;m,&rdquo; said Jane, &ldquo;me being an orphan
girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you are engaged to him?&rdquo; asked my wife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Not engaged, ma&rsquo;am; but he is saving money to
buy a ring&mdash;hammyfist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Jane, when you are properly engaged to
him you may ask him round here on Sunday afternoons,
and have tea with him in the kitchen.&rdquo; For
my Euphemia has a motherly conception of her duty
towards her maid-servants. And presently the amethystine
ring was being worn about the house, even
with ostentation, and Jane developed a new way of
bringing in the joint, so that this gage was evident.
The elder Miss Maitland was aggrieved by it, and
told my wife that servants ought not to wear rings.
But my wife looked it up in <cite>Enquire Within</cite> and
<cite>Mrs. Motherly&rsquo;s Book of Household Management</cite>, and
found no prohibition. So Jane remained with this
happiness added to her love.</p>

<p>The treasure of Jane&rsquo;s heart appeared to me to be
what respectable people call a very deserving young
man. &ldquo;William, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Jane one day suddenly,
with ill-concealed complacency, as she counted out
the beer bottles, &ldquo;William, ma&rsquo;am, is a teetotaller.
Yes, m&rsquo;m; and he don&rsquo;t smoke. Smoking, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo;
said Jane, as one who reads the heart, &ldquo;<em>do</em> make such
a dust about. Beside the waste of money. <em>And</em> the
smell. However, I suppose it&rsquo;s necessary to some.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Possibly it dawned on Jane that she was reflecting
a little severely upon Euphemia&rsquo;s comparative ill-fortune,
and she added kindly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure the master
is a hangel when his pipe&rsquo;s alight. Compared to other
times.&rdquo;</p>

<p>William was at first a rather shabby young man of
the ready-made black coat school of costume. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
had watery grey eyes, and a complexion appropriate
to the brother of one in a Home for the Dying.
Euphemia did not fancy him very much, even at the
beginning. His eminent respectability was vouched
for by an alpaca umbrella, from which he never
allowed himself to be parted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He goes to chapel,&rdquo; said Jane. &ldquo;His papa,
ma&rsquo;am&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His <em>what</em>, Jane?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His papa, ma&rsquo;am, was Church; but Mr. Maynard
is a Plymouth Brother, and William thinks it Policy,
ma&rsquo;am, to go there too. Mr. Maynard comes and
talks to him quite friendly, when they ain&rsquo;t busy,
about using up all the ends of string, and about his
soul. He takes a lot of notice, do Mr. Maynard, of
William, and the way he saves string and his soul,
ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Presently we heard that the head porter at Maynard&rsquo;s
had left, and that William was head porter at
twenty-three shillings a week. &ldquo;He is really kind of
over the man who drives the van,&rdquo; said Jane, &ldquo;and
him married with three children.&rdquo; And she promised
in the pride of her heart to make interest for us with
William to favour us so that we might get our parcels
of drapery from Maynard&rsquo;s with exceptional promptitude.</p>

<p>After this promotion a rapidly increasing prosperity
came upon Jane&rsquo;s young man. One day, we learned
that Mr. Maynard had given William a book. &ldquo;Smiles&rsquo;
Elp Yourself, it&rsquo;s called,&rdquo; said Jane; &ldquo;but it ain&rsquo;t
comic. It tells you how to get on in the world, and
some what William read to me was <em>lovely</em>, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>Euphemia told me of this laughing, and then she
became suddenly grave. &ldquo;Do you know, dear,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;Jane said one thing I did not like. She had
been quiet for a minute, and then she suddenly
remarked, &lsquo;William is a lot above me, ma&rsquo;am, ain&rsquo;t
he?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see anything in that,&rdquo; I said, though later
my eyes were to be opened.</p>

<p>One Sunday afternoon about that time I was sitting
at my writing-desk&mdash;possibly I was reading a good
book&mdash;when a something went by the window. I
heard a startled exclamation behind me, and saw
Euphemia with her hands clasped together and her
eyes dilated. &ldquo;George,&rdquo; she said in an awestricken
whisper, &ldquo;did you see?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then we both spoke to one another at the same
moment, slowly and solemnly: &ldquo;<em>A silk hat! Yellow
gloves! A new umbrella!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may be my fancy, dear,&rdquo; said Euphemia; &ldquo;but
his tie was very like yours. I believe Jane keeps him
in ties. She told me a little while ago in a way that
implied volumes about the rest of your costume,
&lsquo;The master <em>do</em> wear pretty ties, ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo; And he
echoes all your novelties.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young couple passed our window again on
their way to their customary walk. They were arm
in arm. Jane looked exquisitely proud, happy, and
uncomfortable, with new white cotton gloves, and
William, in the silk hat, singularly genteel!</p>

<p>That was the culmination of Jane&rsquo;s happiness.
When she returned, &ldquo;Mr. Maynard has been talking
to William, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and he is to serve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
customers, just like the young shop gentlemen, during
the next sale. And if he gets on, he is to be made
an assistant, ma&rsquo;am, at the first opportunity. He
has got to be as gentlemanly as he can, ma&rsquo;am;
and if he ain&rsquo;t, ma&rsquo;am, he says it won&rsquo;t be for want
of trying. Mr. Maynard has took a great fancy
to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He <em>is</em> getting on, Jane,&rdquo; said my wife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Jane thoughtfully, &ldquo;he <em>is</em> getting
on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And she sighed.</p>

<p>That next Sunday, as I drank my tea, I interrogated
my wife. &ldquo;How is this Sunday different
from all other Sundays, little woman? What has
happened? Have you altered the curtains, or
rearranged the furniture, or where is the indefinable
difference of it? Are you wearing your hair in a
new way without warning me? I clearly perceive a
change in my environment, and I cannot for the life
of me say what it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then my wife answered in her most tragic voice:
&ldquo;George,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that&mdash;that William has not come
near the place to-day! And Jane is crying her heart
out upstairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There followed a period of silence. Jane, as I have
said, stopped singing about the house, and began to
care for our brittle possessions, which struck my wife
as being a very sad sign indeed. The next Sunday,
and the next, Jane asked to go out, &ldquo;to walk with
William,&rdquo; and my wife, who never attempts to extort
confidences, gave her permission, and asked no questions.
On each occasion Jane came back looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
flushed and very determined. At last one day she
became communicative.</p>

<p>&ldquo;William is being led away,&rdquo; she remarked abruptly,
with a catching of the breath, apropos of tablecloths.
&ldquo;Yes, m&rsquo;m. She is a milliner, and she can play on
the piano.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought,&rdquo; said my wife, &ldquo;that you went out with
him on Sunday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not out with him, m&rsquo;m&mdash;after him. I walked
along by the side of them, and told her he was
engaged to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me, Jane, did you? What did they do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Took no more notice of me than if I was dirt.
So I told her she should suffer for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It could not have been a very agreeable walk,
Jane.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not for no parties, ma&rsquo;am.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; said Jane, &ldquo;I could play the piano,
ma&rsquo;am. But anyhow, I don&rsquo;t mean to let <em>her</em> get
him away from me. She&rsquo;s older than him, and her
hair ain&rsquo;t gold to the roots, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was on the August Bank Holiday that the crisis
came. We do not clearly know the details of the
fray, but only such fragments as poor Jane let fall.
She came home dusty, excited, and with her heart
hot within her.</p>

<p>The milliner&rsquo;s mother, the milliner, and William
had made a party to the Art Museum at South
Kensington, I think. Anyhow, Jane had calmly but
firmly accosted them somewhere in the streets, and
asserted her right to what, in spite of the consensus
of literature, she held to be her inalienable property.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
She did, I think, go so far as to lay hands on him.
They dealt with her in a crushingly superior way.
They &ldquo;called a cab.&rdquo; There was a &ldquo;scene,&rdquo; William
being pulled away into the four-wheeler by his future
wife and mother-in-law from the reluctant hands of
our discarded Jane. There were threats of giving
her &ldquo;in charge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My poor Jane!&rdquo; said my wife, mincing veal as
though she was mincing William. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shame of
them. I would think no more of him. He is not
worthy of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, m&rsquo;m,&rdquo; said Jane. &ldquo;He <em>is</em> weak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s that woman has done it,&rdquo; said Jane.
She was never known to bring herself to pronounce
&ldquo;that woman&rsquo;s&rdquo; name or to admit her girlishness.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think what minds some women must
have&mdash;to try and get a girl&rsquo;s young man away
from her. But there, it only hurts to talk about it,&rdquo;
said Jane.</p>

<p>Thereafter our house rested from William. But
there was something in the manner of Jane&rsquo;s scrubbing
the front doorstep or sweeping out the rooms, a
certain viciousness, that persuaded me that the story
had not yet ended.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, m&rsquo;m, may I go and see a wedding to-morrow?&rdquo;
said Jane one day.</p>

<p>My wife knew by instinct whose wedding. &ldquo;Do
you think it is wise, Jane?&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would like to see the last of him,&rdquo; said Jane.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said my wife, fluttering into my room
about twenty minutes after Jane had started, &ldquo;Jane
has been to the boot-hole and taken all the left-off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
boots and shoes, and gone off to the wedding with
them in a bag. Surely she cannot mean&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jane,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;is developing character. Let us
hope for the best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jane came back with a pale, hard face. All the
boots seemed to be still in her bag, at which my wife
heaved a premature sigh of relief. We heard her go
upstairs and replace the boots with considerable
emphasis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite a crowd at the wedding, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; she said
presently, in a purely conversational style, sitting in
our little kitchen, and scrubbing the potatoes; &ldquo;and
such a lovely day for them.&rdquo; She proceeded to numerous
other details, clearly avoiding some cardinal
incident.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was all extremely respectable and nice, ma&rsquo;am;
but <em>her</em> father didn&rsquo;t wear a black coat, and looked
quite out of place, ma&rsquo;am. Mr. Piddingquirk&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Who?</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Piddingquirk&mdash;William that <em>was</em>, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;had
white gloves, and a coat like a clergyman, and a
lovely chrysanthemum. He looked so nice, ma&rsquo;am.
And there was red carpet down, just like for gentlefolks.
And they say he gave the clerk four shillings, ma&rsquo;am.
It was a real kerridge they had&mdash;not a fly. When
they came out of church there was rice-throwing,
and her two little sisters dropping dead flowers.
And someone threw a slipper, and then I threw
a boot&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Threw a <em>boot</em>, Jane!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am. Aimed at <em>her</em>. But it hit <em>him</em>.
Yes, ma&rsquo;am, hard. Gev him a black eye, I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
think. I only threw that one. I hadn&rsquo;t the heart to
try again. All the little boys cheered when it hit
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After an interval&mdash;&ldquo;I am sorry the boot hit <em>him</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another pause. The potatoes were being scrubbed
violently. &ldquo;He always <em>was</em> a bit above me, you
know, ma&rsquo;am. And he was led away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The potatoes were more than finished. Jane rose
sharply, with a sigh, and rapped the basin down on
the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care a rap. He
will find out his mistake yet. It serves me right.
I was stuck up about him. I ought not to have
looked so high. And I am glad things are as things
are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My wife was in the kitchen, seeing to the higher
cookery. After the confession of the boot-throwing,
she must have watched poor Jane fuming with a
certain dismay in those brown eyes of hers. But I
imagine they softened again very quickly, and then
Jane&rsquo;s must have met them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Jane, with an astonishing change
of note, &ldquo;think of all that <em>might</em> have been! Oh,
ma&rsquo;am, I <em>could</em> have been so happy! I ought to have
known, but I didn&rsquo;t know.... You&rsquo;re very kind to
let me talk to you, ma&rsquo;am ... for it&rsquo;s hard on me,
ma&rsquo;am ... it&rsquo;s har-r-r-r-d&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>And I gather that Euphemia so far forgot herself
as to let Jane sob out some of the fulness of her heart
on a sympathetic shoulder. My Euphemia, thank
Heaven, has never properly grasped the importance
of &ldquo;keeping up her position.&rdquo; And since that fit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
weeping, much of the accent of bitterness has gone
out of Jane&rsquo;s scrubbing and brush work.</p>

<p>Indeed, something passed the other day with the
butcher-boy&mdash;but that scarcely belongs to this story.
However, Jane is young still, and time and change
are at work with her. We all have our sorrows, but
I do not believe very much in the existence of sorrows
that never heal.</p>

<span class="f8">AN UNSYMPATHETIC LOVE STORY</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Of</span> course the cultivated reader has heard of
Aubrey Vair. He has published on three
several occasions volumes of delicate verses,&mdash;some,
indeed, border on indelicacy,&mdash;and his column
&ldquo;Of Things Literary&rdquo; in the <cite>Climax</cite> is well known.
His Byronic visage and an interview have appeared
in the <cite>Perfect Lady</cite>. It was Aubrey Vair, I believe,
who demonstrated that the humour of Dickens was
worse than his sentiment, and who detected &ldquo;a
subtle bourgeois flavour&rdquo; in Shakespeare. However,
it is not generally known that Aubrey Vair has
had erotic experiences as well as erotic inspirations.
He adopted Goethe some little time since as his
literary prototype, and that may have had something
to do with his temporary lapse from sexual
integrity.</p>

<p>For it is one of the commonest things that undermine
literary men, giving us landslips and picturesque
effects along the otherwise even cliff of their respectable
life, ranking next to avarice, and certainly above
drink, this instability called genius, or, more fully,
the consciousness of genius, such as Aubrey Vair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
possessed. Since Shelley set the fashion, your man
of gifts has been assured that his duty to himself
and his duty to his wife are incompatible, and his
renunciation of the Philistine has been marked by
such infidelity as his means and courage warranted.
Most virtue is lack of imagination. At anyrate, a
minor genius without his affections twisted into an
inextricable muddle, and who did not occasionally
shed sonnets over his troubles, I have never
met.</p>

<p>Even Aubrey Vair did this, weeping the sonnets
overnight into his blotting-book, and pretending to
write literary <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">causerie</i> when his wife came down in
her bath slippers to see what kept him up. She did
not understand him, of course. He did this even
before the other woman appeared, so ingrained is
conjugal treachery in the talented mind. Indeed, he
wrote more sonnets before the other woman came
than after that event, because thereafter he spent
much of his leisure in cutting down the old productions,
retrimming them, and generally altering
this readymade clothing of his passion to suit her
particular height and complexion.</p>

<p>Aubrey Vair lived in a little red villa with a lawn
at the back and a view of the Downs behind Reigate.
He lived upon discreet investment eked out by
literary work. His wife was handsome, sweet, and
gentle, and&mdash;such is the tender humility of good
married women&mdash;she found her life&rsquo;s happiness in
seeing that little Aubrey Vair had well-cooked
variety for dinner, and that their house was the
neatest and brightest of all the houses they entered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
Aubrey Vair enjoyed the dinners, and was proud of
the house, yet nevertheless he mourned because his
genius dwindled. Moreover, he grew plump, and
corpulence threatened him.</p>

<p>We learn in suffering what we teach in song,
and Aubrey Vair knew certainly that his soul
could give no creditable crops unless his affections
were harrowed. And how to harrow them
was the trouble, for Reigate is a moral neighbourhood.</p>

<p>So Aubrey Vair&rsquo;s romantic longings blew loose for
a time, much as a seedling creeper might, planted in
the midst of a flower-bed. But at last, in the fulness
of time, the other woman came to the embrace of
Aubrey Vair&rsquo;s yearning heart-tendrils, and his
romantic episode proceeded as is here faithfully
written down.</p>

<p>The other woman was really a girl, and Aubrey
Vair met her first at a tennis party at Redhill.
Aubrey Vair did not play tennis after the accident
to Miss Morton&rsquo;s eye, and because latterly it made
him pant and get warmer and moister than even a
poet should be; and this young lady had only
recently arrived in England, and could not play. So
they gravitated into the two vacant basket chairs
beside Mrs. Bayne&rsquo;s deaf aunt, in front of the
hollyhocks, and were presently talking at their ease
together.</p>

<p>The other woman&rsquo;s name was unpropitious,&mdash;Miss
Smith,&mdash;but you would never have suspected it from
her face and costume. Her parentage was promising,
she was an orphan, her mother was a Hindoo, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
her father an Indian civil servant; and Aubrey Vair&mdash;himself
a happy mixture of Kelt and Teuton, as,
indeed, all literary men have to be nowadays&mdash;naturally
believed in the literary consequences of a
mixture of races. She was dressed in white. She
had finely moulded pale features, great depth of
expression, and a cloud of delicately <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">frisé</i> black hair
over her dark eyes, and she looked at Aubrey Vair
with a look half curious and half shy, that contrasted
admirably with the stereotyped frankness of your
common Reigate girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a splendid lawn&mdash;the best in Redhill,&rdquo;
said Aubrey Vair in the course of the conversation;
&ldquo;and I like it all the better because the daisies are
spared.&rdquo; He indicated the daisies with a graceful
sweep of his rather elegant hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are sweet little flowers,&rdquo; said the lady in
white, &ldquo;and I have always associated them with
England, chiefly, perhaps, through a picture I saw
&lsquo;over there&rsquo; when I was very little, of children
making daisy chains. I promised myself that
pleasure when I came home. But, alas! I feel now
rather too large for such delights.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not see why we should not be able to enjoy
these simple pleasures as we grow older&mdash;why our
growth should have in it so much forgetting. For
my own part&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has your wife got Jane&rsquo;s recipe for stuffing
trout?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Bayne&rsquo;s deaf aunt abruptly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Aubrey Vair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bayne&rsquo;s deaf aunt.
&ldquo;It ought to please even you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Anything will please me,&rdquo; said Aubrey Vair; &ldquo;I
care very little&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s a lovely dish,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bayne&rsquo;s deaf
aunt, and relapsed into contemplation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was saying,&rdquo; said Aubrey Vair, &ldquo;that I think I
still find my keenest pleasures in childish pastimes.
I have a little nephew that I see a great deal of, and
when we fly kites together, I am sure it would be
hard to tell which of us is the happier. By the bye,
you should get at your daisy chains in that way.
Beguile some little girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I did. I took that Morton mite for a walk
in the meadows, and timidly broached the subject.
And she reproached me for suggesting &lsquo;frivolous
pursuits.&rsquo; It was a horrible disappointment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The governess here,&rdquo; said Aubrey Vair, &ldquo;is
robbing that child of its youth in a terrible way.
What will a life be that has no childhood at the
beginning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some human beings are never young,&rdquo; he continued,
&ldquo;and they never grow up. They lead
absolutely colourless lives. They are&mdash;they are
etiolated. They never love, and never feel the loss
of it. They are&mdash;for the moment I can think of no
better image&mdash;they are human flower-pots, in which
no soul has been planted. But a human soul properly
growing must begin in a fresh childishness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the dark lady thoughtfully, &ldquo;a careless
childhood, running wild almost. That should be the
beginning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we pass through the wonder and diffidence
of youth.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;To strength and action,&rdquo; said the dark lady.
Her dreamy eyes were fixed on the Downs, and her
fingers tightened on her knees as she spoke. &ldquo;Ah,
it is a grand thing to live&mdash;as a man does&mdash;self-reliant
and free.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so at last,&rdquo; said Aubrey Vair, &ldquo;come to the
culmination and crown of life.&rdquo; He paused and
glanced hastily at her. Then he dropped his voice
almost to a whisper&mdash;&ldquo;And the culmination of life
is love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Their eyes met for a moment, but she looked away
at once. Aubrey Vair felt a peculiar thrill and a
catching in his breath, but his emotions were too
complex for analysis. He had a certain sense of
surprise, also, at the way his conversation had
developed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bayne&rsquo;s deaf aunt suddenly dug him in the
chest with her ear-trumpet, and someone at tennis
bawled, &ldquo;Love all!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did I tell you Jane&rsquo;s girls have had scarlet
fever?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Bayne&rsquo;s deaf aunt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Aubrey Vair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; and they are peeling now,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Bayne&rsquo;s deaf aunt, shutting her lips tightly, and
nodding in a slow, significant manner at both of
them.</p>

<p>There was a pause. All three seemed lost in
thought, too deep for words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Love,&rdquo; began Aubrey Vair presently, in a severely
philosophical tone, leaning back in his chair, holding
his hands like a praying saint&rsquo;s in front of him, and
staring at the toe of his shoe,&mdash;&ldquo;love is, I believe, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
one true and real thing in life. It rises above reason,
interest, or explanation. Yet I never read of an age
when it was so much forgotten as it is now. Never
was love expected to run so much in appointed
channels, never was it so despised, checked, ordered,
and obstructed. Policemen say, &lsquo;This way, Eros!&rsquo;
As a result, we relieve our emotional possibilities in
the hunt for gold and notoriety. And after all, with
the best fortune in these, we only hold up the gilded
images of our success, and are weary slaves, with
unsatisfied hearts, in the pageant of life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aubrey Vair sighed, and there was a pause. The
girl looked at him out of the mysterious darkness of
her eyes. She had read many books, but Aubrey
Vair was her first literary man, and she took this
kind of thing for genius&mdash;as girls have done
before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are,&rdquo; continued Aubrey Vair, conscious of a
favourable impression,&mdash;&ldquo;we are like fireworks, mere
dead, inert things until the appointed spark comes;
and then&mdash;if it is not damp&mdash;the dormant soul blazes
forth in all its warmth and beauty. That is living.
I sometimes think, do you know, that we should
be happier if we could die soon after that golden
time, like the Ephemerides. There is a decay
sets in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eigh?&rdquo; said Mrs. Bayne&rsquo;s deaf aunt startlingly.
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t hear you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was on the point of remarking,&rdquo; shouted Aubrey
Vair, wheeling the array of his thoughts,&mdash;&ldquo;I was on
the point of remarking that few people in Redhill
could match Mrs. Morton&rsquo;s fine broad green.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Others have noticed it,&rdquo; Mrs. Bayne&rsquo;s deaf aunt
shouted back. &ldquo;It is since she has had in her new
false teeth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This interruption dislocated the conversation a
little. However&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must thank you, Mr. Vair,&rdquo; said the dark girl,
when they parted that afternoon, &ldquo;for having given
me very much to think about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And from her manner, Aubrey Vair perceived
clearly he had not wasted his time.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>It would require a subtler pen than mine to tell
how from that day a passion for Miss Smith grew
like Jonah&rsquo;s gourd in the heart of Aubrey Vair. He
became pensive, and in the prolonged absence of
Miss Smith, irritable. Mrs. Aubrey Vair felt the
change in him, and put it down to a vitriolic Saturday
Reviewer. Indisputably the <cite>Saturday</cite> does at times
go a little far. He re-read <cite>Elective Affinities</cite>; and
lent it to Miss Smith. Incredible as it may appear
to members of the Areopagus Club, where we know
Aubrey Vair, he did also beyond all question inspire
a sort of passion in that sombre-eyed, rather clever,
and really very beautiful girl.</p>

<p>He talked to her a lot about love and destiny, and
all that bric-à-brac of the minor poet. And they
talked together about his genius. He elaborately,
though discreetly, sought her society, and presented
and read to her the milder of his unpublished sonnets.
We consider his Byronic features pasty, but the
feminine mind has its own laws. I suppose, also,
where a girl is not a fool, a literary man has an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
enormous advantage over anyone but a preacher, in
the show he can make of his heart&rsquo;s wares.</p>

<p>At last a day in that summer came when he met
her alone, possibly by chance, in a quiet lane towards
Horley. There were ample hedges on either side,
rich with honeysuckle, vetch, and mullein.</p>

<p>They conversed intimately of his poetic ambitions,
and then he read her those verses of his subsequently
published in <cite>Hobson&rsquo;s Magazine</cite>: &ldquo;Tenderly ever,
since I have met thee.&rdquo; He had written these the
day before; and though I think the sentiment is
uncommonly trite, there is a redeeming note of
sincerity about the lines not conspicuous in all
Aubrey Vair&rsquo;s poetry.</p>

<p>He read rather well, and a swell of genuine
emotion crept into his voice as he read, with one
white hand thrown out to point the rhythm of the
lines. &ldquo;Ever, my sweet, for thee,&rdquo; he concluded,
looking up into her face.</p>

<p>Before he looked up, he had been thinking chiefly
of his poem and its effect. Straightway he forgot it.
Her arms hung limply before her, and her hands
were clasped together. Her eyes were very tender.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your verses go to the heart,&rdquo; she said softly.</p>

<p>Her mobile features were capable of wonderful
shades of expression. He suddenly forgot his wife
and his position as a minor poet as he looked at her.
It is possible that his classical features may themselves
have undergone a certain transfiguration. For
one brief moment&mdash;and it was always to linger in his
memory&mdash;destiny lifted him out of his vain little
self to a nobler level of simplicity. The copy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
&ldquo;Tenderly ever&rdquo; fluttered from his hand. Considerations
vanished. Only one thing seemed of
importance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; he said abruptly.</p>

<p>An expression of fear came into her eyes. The
grip of her hands upon one another tightened convulsively.
She became very pale.</p>

<p>Then she moved her lips as if to speak, bringing
her face slightly nearer to his. There was nothing in
the world at that moment for either of them but one
another. They were both trembling exceedingly.
In a whisper she said, &ldquo;You love me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aubrey Vair stood quivering and speechless, looking
into her eyes. He had never seen such a light
as he saw there before. He was in a wild tumult
of emotion. He was dreadfully scared at what he
had done. He could not say another word. He
nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And this has come to me?&rdquo; she said presently, in
the same awe-stricken whisper, and then, &ldquo;Oh, my
love, my love!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And thereupon Aubrey Vair had her clasped to
himself, her cheek upon his shoulder and his lips
to hers.</p>

<p>Thus it was that Aubrey Vair came by the
cardinal memory of his life. To this day it recurs
in his works.</p>

<p>A little boy clambering in the hedge some way
down the lane saw this group with surprise, and
then with scorn and contempt. Recking nothing of
his destiny, he turned away, feeling that he at least
could never come to the unspeakable unmanliness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
of hugging girls. Unhappily for Reigate scandal,
his shame for his sex was altogether too deep for
words.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>An hour after, Aubrey Vair returned home in a
hushed mood. There were muffins after his own
heart for his tea&mdash;Mrs. Aubrey Vair had had hers.
And there were chrysanthemums, chiefly white ones,&mdash;flowers
he loved,&mdash;set out in the china bowl he was
wont to praise. And his wife came behind him to
kiss him as he sat eating.</p>

<p>&ldquo;De lill Jummuns,&rdquo; she remarked, kissing him
under the ear.</p>

<p>Then it came into the mind of Aubrey Vair with
startling clearness, while his ear was being kissed,
and with his mouth full of muffin, that life is a
singularly complex thing.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>The summer passed at last into the harvest-time,
and the leaves began falling. It was evening, the
warm sunset light still touched the Downs, but up
the valley a blue haze was creeping. One or two
lamps in Reigate were already alight.</p>

<p>About half-way up the slanting road that scales
the Downs, there is a wooden seat where one may
obtain a fine view of the red villas scattered below,
and of the succession of blue hills beyond. Here the
girl with the shadowy face was sitting.</p>

<p>She had a book on her knees, but it lay neglected.
She was leaning forward, her chin resting upon her
hand. She was looking across the valley into the
darkening sky, with troubled eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>Aubrey Vair appeared through the hazel-bushes,
and sat down beside her. He held half a dozen dead
leaves in his hand.</p>

<p>She did not alter her attitude. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it to be flight?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>Aubrey Vair was rather pale. He had been having
bad nights latterly, with dreams of the Continental
Express, Mrs. Aubrey Vair possibly even in pursuit,&mdash;he
always fancied her making the tragedy ridiculous
by tearfully bringing additional pairs of socks,
and any such trifles he had forgotten, with her,&mdash;all
Reigate and Redhill in commotion. He had never
eloped before, and he had visions of difficulties with
hotel proprietors. Mrs. Aubrey Vair might telegraph
ahead. Even he had had a prophetic vision
of a headline in a halfpenny evening newspaper:
&ldquo;Young Lady abducts a Minor Poet.&rdquo; So there
was a quaver in his voice as he asked, &ldquo;Is it to be
flight?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you will,&rdquo; she answered, still not looking at
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want you to consider particularly how this will
affect you. A man,&rdquo; said Aubrey Vair, slowly, and
staring hard at the leaves in his hand, &ldquo;even gains
a certain éclat in these affairs. But to a woman it is
ruin&mdash;social, moral.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is not love,&rdquo; said the girl in white.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, my dearest! Think of yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stupid!&rdquo; she said, under her breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You spoke?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But cannot we go on, meeting one another, loving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
one another, without any great scandal or misery?
Could we not&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; interrupted Miss Smith, &ldquo;would be unspeakably
horrible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a dreadful conversation to me. Life is so
intricate, such a web of subtle strands binds us this
way and that. I cannot tell what is right. You
must consider&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A man would break such strands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no manliness,&rdquo; said Aubrey Vair, with a
sudden glow of moral exaltation, &ldquo;in doing wrong.
My love&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We could at least die together, dearest,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; said Aubrey Vair. &ldquo;I mean&mdash;consider
my wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have not considered her hitherto.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a flavour&mdash;of cowardice, of desertion,
about suicide,&rdquo; said Aubrey Vair. &ldquo;Frankly, I have
the English prejudice, and do not like any kind of
running away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Smith smiled very faintly. &ldquo;I see clearly
now what I did not see. My love and yours are
very different things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Possibly it is a sexual difference,&rdquo; said Aubrey
Vair; and then, feeling the remark inadequate, he
relapsed into silence.</p>

<p>They sat for some time without a word. The two
lights in Reigate below multiplied to a score of
bright points, and, above, one star had become
visible. She began laughing, an almost noiseless,
hysterical laugh that jarred unaccountably upon
Aubrey Vair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>Presently she stood up. &ldquo;They will wonder where
I am,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I think I must be going.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He followed her to the road. &ldquo;Then this is the
end?&rdquo; he said, with a curious mixture of relief and
poignant regret.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, this is the end,&rdquo; she answered, and turned
away.</p>

<p>There straightway dropped into the soul of Aubrey
Vair a sense of infinite loss. It was an altogether
new sensation. She was perhaps twenty yards away,
when he groaned aloud with the weight of it, and
suddenly began running after her with his arms
extended.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Annie,&rdquo; he cried,&mdash;&ldquo;Annie! I have been talking
<em>rot</em>. Annie, now I know I love you! I cannot spare
you. This must not be. I did not understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The weight was horrible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, stop, Annie!&rdquo; he cried, with a breaking voice,
and there were tears on his face.</p>

<p>She turned upon him suddenly, and his arms fell
by his side. His expression changed at the sight of
her pale face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not understand,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I have said
good-bye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at him; he was evidently greatly
distressed, a little out of breath, and he had just
stopped blubbering. His contemptible quality reached
the pathetic. She came up close to him, and, taking
his damp Byronic visage between her hands, she
kissed him again and again. &ldquo;Good-bye, little man
that I loved,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and good-bye to this folly
of love.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, with something that may have been a laugh
or a sob,&mdash;she herself, when she came to write it all
in her novel, did not know which,&mdash;she turned and
hurried away again, and went out of the path that
Aubrey Vair must pursue, at the cross-roads.</p>

<p>Aubrey Vair stood, where she had kissed him,
with a mind as inactive as his body, until her white
dress had disappeared. Then he gave an involuntary
sigh, a large exhaustive expiration, and so awoke
himself, and began walking, pensively dragging his
feet through the dead leaves, home. Emotions are
terrible things.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>&ldquo;Do you like the potatoes, dear?&rdquo; asked Mrs.
Aubrey Vair at dinner. &ldquo;I cooked them myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aubrey Vair descended slowly from cloudy, impalpable
meditations to the level of fried potatoes.
&ldquo;These potatoes&rdquo;&mdash;he remarked, after a pause during
which he was struggling with recollection. &ldquo;Yes.
These potatoes have exactly the tints of the dead
leaves of the hazel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a fanciful poet it is!&rdquo; said Mrs. Aubrey
Vair. &ldquo;Taste them. They are very nice potatoes
indeed.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">The</span> little shop was not paying. The realisation
came insensibly. Winslow was not the man
for definite addition and subtraction and
sudden discovery. He became aware of the truth
in his mind gradually, as though it had always been
there. A lot of facts had converged and led him
there. There was that line of cretonnes&mdash;four half-pieces&mdash;untouched,
save for half a yard sold to cover
a stool. There were those shirtings at 4¾d.&mdash;Bandersnatch,
in the Broadway, was selling them at 2¾d.&mdash;under
cost, in fact. (Surely Bandersnatch might let
a man live!) Those servants&rsquo; caps, a selling line,
needed replenishing, and that brought back the
memory of Winslow&rsquo;s sole wholesale dealers, Helter,
Skelter, &amp; Grab. Why! how about their account?</p>

<p>Winslow stood with a big green box open on the
counter before him when he thought of it. His pale
grey eyes grew a little rounder; his pale, straggling
moustache twitched. He had been drifting along,
day after day. He went round to the ramshackle
cash-desk in the corner&mdash;it was Winslow&rsquo;s weakness
to sell his goods over the counter, give his customers
a duplicate bill, and then dodge into the desk to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
receive the money, as though he doubted his own
honesty. His lank forefinger, with the prominent
joints, ran down the bright little calendar (&ldquo;Clack&rsquo;s
Cottons last for All Time&rdquo;). &ldquo;One&mdash;two&mdash;three;
three weeks an&rsquo; a day!&rdquo; said Winslow, staring.
&ldquo;March! Only three weeks and a day. It <em>can&rsquo;t</em> be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tea, dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Winslow, opening the door
with the glass window and the white blind that communicated
with the parlour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One minute,&rdquo; said Winslow, and began unlocking
the desk.</p>

<p>An irritable old gentleman, very hot and red about
the face, and in a heavy fur-lined cloak, came in
noisily. Mrs. Winslow vanished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; said the old gentleman. &ldquo;Pocket-handkerchief.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Winslow. &ldquo;About what price&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; said the old gentleman. &ldquo;Poggit-handkerchief,
quig!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Winslow began to feel flustered. He produced
two boxes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These, sir&rdquo;&mdash;began Winslow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sheed tin!&rdquo; said the old gentleman, clutching the
stiffness of the linen. &ldquo;Wad to blow my nose&mdash;not
haggit about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A cotton one, p&rsquo;raps, sir?&rdquo; said Winslow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much?&rdquo; said the old gentleman over the
handkerchief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sevenpence, sir. There&rsquo;s nothing more I can
show you? No ties, braces&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Damn!&rdquo; said the old gentleman, fumbling in his
ticket-pocket, and finally producing half a crown.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
Winslow looked round for his little metallic duplicate-book
which he kept in various fixtures, according
to circumstances, and then he caught the old
gentleman&rsquo;s eye. He went straight to the desk at
once and got the change, with an entire disregard of
the routine of the shop.</p>

<p>Winslow was always more or less excited by a
customer. But the open desk reminded him of his
trouble. It did not come back to him all at once.
He heard a finger-nail softly tapping on the glass,
and, looking up, saw Minnie&rsquo;s eyes over the blind.
It seemed like retreat opening. He shut and locked
the desk, and went into the little room to tea.</p>

<p>But he was preoccupied. Three weeks and a day!
He took unusually large bites of his bread and butter,
and stared hard at the little pot of jam. He answered
Minnie&rsquo;s conversational advances distractedly. The
shadow of Helter, Skelter, &amp; Grab lay upon the tea-table.
He was struggling with this new idea of
failure, the tangible realisation, that was taking
shape and substance, condensing, as it were, out of
the misty uneasiness of many days. At present it
was simply one concrete fact; there were thirty-nine
pounds left in the bank, and that day three weeks
Messrs. Helter, Skelter, &amp; Grab, those enterprising
outfitters of young men, would demand their eighty
pounds.</p>

<p>After tea there was a customer or so&mdash;little purchases:
some muslin and buckram, dress-protectors,
tape, and a pair of Lisle hose. Then, knowing that
Black Care was lurking in the dusky corners of the
shop, he lit the three lamps early and set to, refolding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
his cotton prints, the most vigorous and least meditative
proceeding of which he could think. He could see
Minnie&rsquo;s shadow in the other room as she moved
about the table. She was busy turning an old dress.
He had a walk after supper, looked in at the Y.M.C.A.,
but found no one to talk to, and finally went to bed.
Minnie was already there. And there, too, waiting
for him, nudging him gently, until about midnight he
was hopelessly awake, sat Black Care.</p>

<p>He had had one or two nights lately in that company,
but this was much worse. First came Messrs.
Helter, Skelter, &amp; Grab, and their demand for eighty
pounds&mdash;an enormous sum when your original capital
was only a hundred and seventy. They camped, as
it were, before him, sat down and beleaguered him.
He clutched feebly at the circumambient darkness
for expedients. Suppose he had a sale, sold things
for almost anything? He tried to imagine a sale
miraculously successful in some unexpected manner,
and mildly profitable, in spite of reductions below
cost. Then Bandersnatch Limited, 101, 102, 103,
105, 106, 107 Broadway, joined the siege, a long
caterpillar of frontage, a battery of shop fronts,
wherein things were sold at a farthing above cost.
How could he fight such an establishment? Besides,
what had he to sell? He began to review his resources.
What taking line was there to bait the
sale? Then straightway came those pieces of cretonne,
yellow and black, with a bluish-green flower;
those discredited skirtings, prints without buoyancy,
skirmishing haberdashery, some despairful four-button
gloves by an inferior maker&mdash;a hopeless crew. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
that was his force against Bandersnatch, Helter,
Skelter, &amp; Grab, and the pitiless world behind them.
Whatever had made him think a mortal would buy
such things? Why had he bought this and neglected
that? He suddenly realised the intensity of his hatred
for Helter, Skelter, &amp; Grab&rsquo;s salesman. Then he
drove towards an agony of self-reproach. He had
spent too much on that cash-desk. What real need
was there of a desk? He saw his vanity of that desk
in a lurid glow of self-discovery. And the lamps?
Five pounds! Then suddenly, with what was almost
physical pain, he remembered the rent.</p>

<p>He groaned and turned over. And there, dim in
the darkness, was the hummock of Mrs. Winslow&rsquo;s
shoulders. That set him off in another direction.
He became acutely sensible of Minnie&rsquo;s want of feeling.
Here he was, worried to death about business,
and she sleeping like a little child. He regretted
having married, with that infinite bitterness that only
comes to the human heart in the small hours of the
morning. That hummock of white seemed absolutely
without helpfulness, a burden, a responsibility.
What fools men were to marry! Minnie&rsquo;s inert
repose irritated him so much that he was almost
provoked to wake her up and tell her that they
were &ldquo;Ruined.&rdquo; She would have to go back to her
uncle; her uncle had always been against him: and
as for his own future, Winslow was exceedingly uncertain.
A shop assistant who has once set up for
himself finds the utmost difficulty in getting into a
situation again. He began to figure himself &ldquo;crib-hunting&rdquo;
again, going from this wholesale house to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
that, writing innumerable letters. How he hated
writing letters! &ldquo;Sir,&mdash;Referring to your advertisement
in the <cite>Christian World</cite>.&rdquo; He beheld an infinite
vista of discomfort and disappointment, ending&mdash;in
a gulf.</p>

<p>He dressed, yawning, and went down to open the
shop. He felt tired before the day began. As he
carried the shutters in, he kept asking himself what
good he was doing. The end was inevitable, whether
he bothered or not. The clear daylight smote into
the place, and showed how old and rough and splintered
was the floor, how shabby the second-hand
counter, how hopeless the whole enterprise. He had
been dreaming these past six months of a bright
little shop, of a happy couple, of a modest but comely
profit flowing in. He had suddenly awakened from
his dream. The braid that bound his decent black
coat&mdash;it was a little loose&mdash;caught against the catch
of the shop door, and was torn loose. This suddenly
turned his wretchedness to wrath. He stood quivering
for a moment, then, with a spiteful clutch, tore
the braid looser, and went in to Minnie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said, with infinite reproach; &ldquo;look
here! You might look after a chap a bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see it was torn,&rdquo; said Minnie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You never do,&rdquo; said Winslow, with gross injustice,
&ldquo;until things are too late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Minnie looked suddenly at his face. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll sew it
now, Sid, if you like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have breakfast first,&rdquo; said Winslow, &ldquo;and do
things at their proper time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was preoccupied at breakfast, and Minnie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
watched him anxiously. His only remark was to
declare his egg a bad one. It wasn&rsquo;t; it was a little
flavoury,&mdash;being one of those at fifteen a shilling,&mdash;but
quite nice. He pushed it away from him, and
then, having eaten a slice of bread and butter, admitted
himself in the wrong by resuming the egg.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sid,&rdquo; said Minnie, as he stood up to go into the
shop again, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m <em>well</em> enough.&rdquo; He looked at her as though
he hated her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s something else the matter. You
aren&rsquo;t angry with me, Sid, are you, about that
braid? <em>Do</em> tell me what&rsquo;s the matter. You were just
like this at tea yesterday, and at supper-time. It
wasn&rsquo;t the braid then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m likely to be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked interrogation. &ldquo;Oh, what <em>is</em> the
matter?&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>It was too good a chance to miss, and he brought
the evil news out with dramatic force. &ldquo;Matter?&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;I done my best, and here we are. That&rsquo;s the
matter! If I can&rsquo;t pay Helter, Skelter &amp; Grab eighty
pounds, this day three week&rdquo;&mdash;Pause. &ldquo;We shall
be sold up! Sold up! That&rsquo;s the matter, Min!
<span class="smcap">Sold up!</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Sid!&rdquo; began Minnie.</p>

<p>He slammed the door. For the moment he felt
relieved of at least half his misery. He began dusting
boxes that did not require dusting, and then
reblocked a cretonne already faultlessly blocked.
He was in a state of grim wretchedness; a martyr
under the harrow of fate. At anyrate, it should not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
be said he failed for want of industry. And how
he had planned and contrived and worked! All to
this end! He felt horrible doubts. Providence and
Bandersnatch&mdash;surely they were incompatible! Perhaps
he was being &ldquo;tried&rdquo;? That sent him off upon
a new tack, a very comforting one. That martyr
pose, the gold-in-the-furnace attitude, lasted all the
morning.</p>

<p>At dinner&mdash;&ldquo;potato pie&rdquo;&mdash;he looked up suddenly,
and saw Minnie&rsquo;s face regarding him. Pale she
looked, and a little red about the eyes. Something
caught him suddenly with a queer effect upon his
throat. All his thoughts seemed to wheel round into
quite a new direction.</p>

<p>He pushed back his plate and stared at her
blankly. Then he got up, went round the table to
her&mdash;she staring at him. He dropped on his knees
beside her without a word. &ldquo;Oh, Minnie!&rdquo; he said,
and suddenly she knew it was peace, and put her arms
about him, as he began to sob and weep.</p>

<p>He cried like a little boy, slobbering on her shoulder
that he was a knave to have married her and brought
her to this, that he hadn&rsquo;t the wits to be trusted with
a penny, that it was all his fault, that he &ldquo;<em>had</em> hoped
<em>so</em>&rdquo;&mdash;ending in a howl. And she, crying gently herself,
patting his shoulders, said &ldquo;<em>Ssh!</em>&rdquo; softly to his
noisy weeping, and so soothed the outbreak. Then
suddenly the crazy little bell upon the shop door
began, and Winslow had to jump to his feet, and be
a man again.</p>

<p>After that scene they &ldquo;talked it over&rdquo; at tea, at
supper, in bed, at every possible interval in between,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
solemnly&mdash;quite inconclusively&mdash;with set faces and
eyes for the most part staring in front of them&mdash;and
yet with a certain mutual comfort. &ldquo;What to do
I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; was Winslow&rsquo;s main proposition.
Minnie tried to take a cheerful view of service&mdash;with
a probable baby. But she found she needed
all her courage. And her uncle would help her
again, perhaps, just at the critical time. It didn&rsquo;t
do for folks to be too proud. Besides, &ldquo;something
might happen,&rdquo; a favourite formula with her.</p>

<p>One hopeful line was to anticipate a sudden afflux
of customers. &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Minnie, &ldquo;you might
get together fifty. They know you well enough to
trust you a bit.&rdquo; They debated that point. Once
the possibility of Helter, Skelter and Grab giving
credit was admitted, it was pleasant to begin sweating
the acceptable minimum. For some half-hour
over tea the second day after Winslow&rsquo;s discoveries
they were quite cheerful again, laughing even at
their terrific fears. Even twenty pounds to go on
with might be considered enough. Then in some
mysterious way the pleasant prospect of Messrs.
Helter, Skelter, &amp; Grab tempering the wind to
the shorn retailer vanished&mdash;vanished absolutely,
and Winslow found himself again in the pit of
despair.</p>

<p>He began looking about at the furniture, and
wondering idly what it would fetch. The chiffonier
was good, anyhow, and there were Minnie&rsquo;s old
plates that her mother used to have. Then he
began to think of desperate expedients for putting
off the evil day. He had heard somewhere of Bills<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
of Sale&mdash;there was to his ears something comfortingly
substantial in the phrase. Then, why not &ldquo;Go to the
Money-Lenders&rdquo;?</p>

<p>One cheering thing happened on Thursday afternoon;
a little girl came in with a pattern of &ldquo;print,&rdquo;
and he was able to match it. He had not been able
to match anything out of his meagre stock before.
He went in and told Minnie. The incident is mentioned
lest the reader should imagine it was uniform
despair with him.</p>

<p>The next morning, and the next, after the discovery,
Winslow opened shop late. When one has
been awake most of the night, and has no hope,
what <em>is</em> the good of getting up punctually? But as
he went into the dark shop on Friday he saw
something lying on the floor, something lit by the
bright light that came under the ill-fitting door&mdash;a
black oblong. He stooped and picked up an
envelope with a deep mourning edge. It was
addressed to his wife. Clearly a death in her family&mdash;perhaps
her uncle. He knew the man too well to
have expectations. And they would have to get
mourning and go to the funeral. The brutal cruelty
of people dying! He saw it all in a flash&mdash;he always
visualised his thoughts. Black trousers to get, black
crape, black gloves&mdash;none in stock&mdash;the railway fares,
the shop closed for the day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid there&rsquo;s bad news, Minnie,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>She was kneeling before the fireplace, blowing the
fire. She had her housemaid&rsquo;s gloves on and the old
country sun-bonnet she wore of a morning, to keep
the dust out of her hair. She turned, saw the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
envelope, gave a gasp, and pressed two bloodless
lips together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s uncle,&rdquo; she said, holding the letter
and staring with eyes wide open into Winslow&rsquo;s face.
&ldquo;<em>It&rsquo;s a strange hand!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The postmark&rsquo;s Hull,&rdquo; said Winslow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The postmark&rsquo;s Hull.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Minnie opened the letter slowly, drew it out,
hesitated, turned it over, saw the signature. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
Mr. Speight!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does he say?&rdquo; said Winslow.</p>

<p>Minnie began to read. &ldquo;<em>Oh!</em>&rdquo; she screamed. She
dropped the letter, collapsed into a crouching heap,
her hands covering her eyes. Winslow snatched at
it. &ldquo;A most terrible accident has occurred,&rdquo; he read;
&ldquo;Melchior&rsquo;s chimney fell down yesterday evening
right on the top of your uncle&rsquo;s house, and every
living soul was killed&mdash;your uncle, your cousin Mary,
Will and Ned, and the girl&mdash;every one of them, and
smashed&mdash;you would hardly know them. I&rsquo;m writing
to you to break the news before you see it in the
papers&rdquo;&mdash;The letter fluttered from Winslow&rsquo;s
fingers. He put out his hand against the mantel
to steady himself.</p>

<p>All of them dead! Then he saw, as in a vision,
a row of seven cottages, each let at seven shillings
a week, a timber yard, two villas, and the ruins&mdash;still
marketable&mdash;of the avuncular residence. He tried
to feel a sense of loss and could not. They were
sure to have been left to Minnie&rsquo;s aunt. All dead!
7×7×52÷20 began insensibly to work itself out in
his mind, but discipline was ever weak in his mental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
arithmetic; figures kept moving from one line to
another, like children playing at Widdy, Widdy Way.
Was it two hundred pounds about&mdash;or one hundred
pounds? Presently he picked up the letter again,
and finishing reading it. &ldquo;You being the next of
kin,&rdquo; said Mr. Speight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How <em>awful</em>!&rdquo; said Minnie in a horror-struck
whisper, and looking up at last. Winslow stared
back at her, shaking his head solemnly. There
were a thousand things running through his mind,
but none that, even to his dull sense, seemed appropriate
as a remark. &ldquo;It was the Lord&rsquo;s will,&rdquo; he
said at last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems so very, very terrible,&rdquo; said Minnie;
&ldquo;auntie, dear auntie&mdash;Ted&mdash;poor, dear uncle&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was the Lord&rsquo;s will, Minnie,&rdquo; said Winslow, with
infinite feeling. A long silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Minnie, very slowly, staring thoughtfully
at the crackling black paper in the grate. The
fire had gone out. &ldquo;Yes, perhaps it was the Lord&rsquo;s
will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They looked gravely at one another. Each would
have been terribly shocked at any mention of the
property by the other. She turned to the dark fireplace
and began tearing up an old newspaper slowly.
Whatever our losses may be, the world&rsquo;s work still
waits for us. Winslow gave a deep sigh and walked
in a hushed manner towards the front door. As he
opened it, a flood of sunlight came streaming into the
dark shadows of the closed shop. Bandersnatch,
Helter, Skelter, &amp; Grab, had vanished out of his mind
like the mists before the rising sun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>Presently he was carrying in the shutters, and in
the briskest way, the fire in the kitchen was crackling
exhilaratingly, with a little saucepan walloping above
it, for Minnie was boiling two eggs,&mdash;one for herself
this morning, as well as one for him,&mdash;and Minnie
herself was audible, laying breakfast with the greatest
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éclat</i>. The blow was a sudden and terrible one&mdash;but
it behoves us to face such things bravely in this sad,
unaccountable world. It was quite midday before
either of them mentioned the cottages.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_LOST_INHERITANCE" id="THE_LOST_INHERITANCE">THE LOST INHERITANCE</a></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;My</span> uncle,&rdquo; said the man with the glass eye,
&ldquo;was what you might call a hemi-semi-demi
millionaire. He was worth about a
hundred and twenty thousand. Quite. And he left
me all his money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I glanced at the shiny sleeve of his coat, and my
eye travelled up to the frayed collar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every penny,&rdquo; said the man with the glass eye,
and I caught the active pupil looking at me with a
touch of offence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never had any windfalls like that,&rdquo; I
said, trying to speak enviously and propitiate
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even a legacy isn&rsquo;t always a blessing,&rdquo; he remarked
with a sigh, and with an air of philosophical
resignation he put the red nose and
the wiry moustache into his tankard for a
space.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was an author, you see, and he wrote a lot
of books.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was the trouble of it all.&rdquo; He stared at me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
with the available eye to see if I grasped his statement,
then averted his face a little and produced a
toothpick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he said, smacking his lips after a pause,
&ldquo;it was like this. He was my uncle&mdash;my maternal
uncle. And he had&mdash;what shall I call it?&mdash;a weakness
for writing edifying literature. Weakness is
hardly the word&mdash;downright mania is nearer the
mark. He&rsquo;d been librarian in a Polytechnic, and as
soon as the money came to him he began to indulge
his ambition. It&rsquo;s a simply extraordinary and incomprehensible
thing to me. Here was a man of
thirty-seven suddenly dropped into a perfect pile of
gold, and he didn&rsquo;t go&mdash;not a day&rsquo;s bust on it. One
would think a chap would go and get himself dressed
a bit decent&mdash;say a couple of dozen pairs of trousers
at a West End tailor&rsquo;s; but he never did. You&rsquo;d
hardly believe it, but when he died he hadn&rsquo;t even a
gold watch. It seems wrong for people like that to
have money. All he did was just to take a house,
and order in pretty nearly five tons of books and ink
and paper, and set to writing edifying literature as
hard as ever he could write. I <em>can&rsquo;t</em> understand it!
But he did. The money came to him, curiously
enough, through a maternal uncle of <em>his</em>, unexpected
like, when he was seven-and-thirty. My mother, it
happened, was his only relation in the wide, wide
world, except some second cousins of his. And I
was her only son. You follow all that? The second
cousins had one only son, too, but they brought him
to see the old man too soon. He was rather a spoilt
youngster, was this son of theirs, and directly he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
set eyes on my uncle, he began bawling out as
hard as he could. &lsquo;Take &rsquo;im away&mdash;er,&rsquo; he says,
&lsquo;take &rsquo;im away,&rsquo; and so did for himself entirely. It
was pretty straight sailing, you&rsquo;d think, for me,
eh? And my mother, being a sensible, careful
woman, settled the business in her own mind long
before he did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was a curious little chap, was my uncle, as
I remember him. I don&rsquo;t wonder at the kid being
scared. Hair, just like these Japanese dolls they sell,
black and straight and stiff all round the brim and
none in the middle, and below, a whitish kind of face
and rather large dark grey eyes moving about behind
his spectacles. He used to attach a great deal of
importance to dress, and always wore a flapping
overcoat and a big-brimmed felt hat of a most extraordinary
size. He looked a rummy little beggar,
I can tell you. Indoors it was, as a rule, a dirty
red flannel dressing-gown and a black skull-cap he
had. That black skull-cap made him look like the
portraits of all kinds of celebrated people. He
was always moving about from house to house,
was my uncle, with his chair which had belonged to
Savage Landor, and his two writing-tables, one of
Carlyle&rsquo;s and the other of Shelley&rsquo;s, so the dealer
told him, and the completest portable reference
library in England, he said he had&mdash;and he lugged
the whole caravan, now to a house at Down, near
Darwin&rsquo;s old place, then to Reigate, near Meredith,
then off to Haslemere, then back to Chelsea for a bit,
and then up to Hampstead. He knew there was
something wrong with his stuff, but he never knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
there was anything wrong with his brains. It was
always the air, or the water, or the altitude, or some
tommy-rot like that. &lsquo;So much depends on environment,&rsquo;
he used to say, and stare at you hard,
as if he half suspected you were hiding a grin
at him somewhere under your face. &lsquo;So much
depends on environment to a sensitive mind like
mine.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was his name? You wouldn&rsquo;t know it
if I told you. He wrote nothing that anyone has
ever read&mdash;nothing. No one <em>could</em> read it. He
wanted to be a great teacher, he said, and he didn&rsquo;t
know what he wanted to teach any more than a
child. So he just blethered at large about Truth
and Righteousness, and the Spirit of History, and
all that. Book after book he wrote and published
at his own expense. He wasn&rsquo;t quite right in
his head, you know, really; and to hear him go
on at the critics&mdash;not because they slated him,
mind you&mdash;he liked that&mdash;but because they didn&rsquo;t
take any notice of him at all. &lsquo;What do the
nations want?&rsquo; he would ask, holding out his
brown old claw. &lsquo;Why, teaching&mdash;guidance! They
are scattered upon the hills like sheep without a
shepherd. There is War and Rumours of War,
the unlaid Spirit of Discord abroad in the land,
Nihilism, Vivisection, Vaccination, Drunkenness,
Penury, Want, Socialistic Error, Selfish Capital!
Do you see the clouds, Ted?&rsquo;&mdash;My name,
you know&mdash;&lsquo;Do you see the clouds lowering
over the land? and behind it all&mdash;the Mongol
waits!&rsquo; He was always very great on Mongols<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
and the Spectre of Socialism, and such-like
things.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then out would come his finger at me, and with
his eyes all afire and his skull-cap askew, he would
whisper: &lsquo;And here am I. What do I want?
Nations to teach. Nations! I say it with all
modesty, Ted, I <em>could</em>. I would guide them; nay!
but I <em>will</em> guide them to a safe haven, to the
land of Righteousness, flowing with milk and
honey.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how he used to go on. Ramble, rave
about the nations, and righteousness, and that kind
of thing. Kind of mincemeat of Bible and blethers.
From fourteen up to three-and-twenty, when I might
have been improving my mind, my mother used to
wash me and brush my hair (at least in the earlier
years of it), with a nice parting down the middle,
and take me, once or twice a week, to hear this old
lunatic jabber about things he had read of in the
morning papers, trying to do it as much like Carlyle
as he could, and I used to sit according to instructions,
and look intelligent and nice, and pretend to
be taking it all in. Afterwards I used to go of my
own free will, out of a regard for the legacy. I was
the only person that used to go and see him. He
wrote, I believe, to every man who made the slightest
stir in the world, sending him a copy or so of his
books, and inviting him to come and talk about the
nations to him; but half of them didn&rsquo;t answer, and
none ever came. And when the girl let you in&mdash;she
was an artful bit of goods, that girl&mdash;there were heaps
of letters on the hall-seat waiting to go off, addressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
to Prince Bismark, the President of the United States,
and such-like people. And one went up the staircase
and along the cobwebby passage,&mdash;the housekeeper
drank like fury, and his passages were always cobwebby,&mdash;and
found him at last, with books turned
down all over the room, and heaps of torn paper on
the floor, and telegrams and newspapers littered
about, and empty coffee-cups and half-eaten bits
of toast on the desk and the mantel. You&rsquo;d see
his back humped up, and his hair would be sticking
out quite straight between the collar of that dressing-gown
thing and the edge of the skull-cap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A moment!&rsquo; he would say. &lsquo;A moment!&rsquo; over
his shoulder. &lsquo;The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mot juste</i>, you know, Ted, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le
mot juste</i>. Righteous thought righteously expressed&mdash;Aah!&mdash;concatenation.
And now, Ted,&rsquo; he&rsquo;d say,
spinning round in his study chair, &lsquo;how&rsquo;s Young
England?&rsquo; That was his silly name for me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that was my uncle, and that was how he
talked&mdash;to me, at anyrate. With others about he
seemed a bit shy. And he not only talked to me,
but he gave me his books, books of six hundred pages
or so, with cock-eyed headings, &lsquo;The Shrieking Sisterhood,&rsquo;
&lsquo;The Behemoth of Bigotry,&rsquo; &lsquo;Crucibles and
Cullenders,&rsquo; and so on. All very strong, and none of
them original. The very last time but one that I saw
him he gave me a book. He was feeling ill even then,
and his hand shook and he was despondent. I
noticed it because I was naturally on the look-out
for those little symptoms. &lsquo;My last book, Ted,&rsquo; he
said. &lsquo;My last book, my boy; my last word to the
deaf and hardened nations;&rsquo; and I&rsquo;m hanged if a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
tear didn&rsquo;t go rolling down his yellow old cheek. He
was regular crying because it was so nearly over, and
he hadn&rsquo;t only written about fifty-three books of
rubbish. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve sometimes thought, Ted&rsquo;&mdash;he said,
and stopped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Perhaps I&rsquo;ve been a bit hasty and angry with
this stiff-necked generation. A little more sweetness,
perhaps, and a little less blinding light. I&rsquo;ve sometimes
thought&mdash;I might have swayed them. But I&rsquo;ve
done my best, Ted.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then, with a burst, for the first and last time
in his life he owned himself a failure. It showed he
was really ill. He seemed to think for a minute, and
then he spoke quietly and low, as sane and sober as I
am now. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been a fool, Ted,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been
flapping nonsense all my life. Only He who readeth
the heart knows whether this is anything more than
vanity. Ted, I don&rsquo;t. But He knows, He knows,
and if I have done foolishly and vainly, in my heart&mdash;in
my heart&rsquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just like that he spoke, repeating himself, and he
stopped quite short and handed the book to me,
trembling. Then the old shine came back into his
eye. I remember it all fairly well, because I repeated
it and acted it to my old mother when I got home,
to cheer her up a bit. &lsquo;Take this book and read
it,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s my last word, my very last word.
I&rsquo;ve left all my property to you, Ted, and may you
use it better than I have done.&rsquo; And then he fell
a-coughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember that quite well even now, and how I
went home cock-a-hoop, and how he was in bed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
next time I called. The housekeeper was downstairs
drunk, and I fooled about&mdash;as a young man will&mdash;with
the girl in the passage before I went to him.
He was sinking fast. But even then his vanity clung
to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Have you read it?&rsquo; he whispered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sat up all night reading it,&rsquo; I said in his ear to
cheer him. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the last,&rsquo; said I, and then, with a
memory of some poetry or other in my head, &lsquo;but
it&rsquo;s the bravest and best.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He smiled a little and tried to squeeze my hand
as a woman might do, and left off squeezing in the
middle, and lay still. &lsquo;The bravest and the best,&rsquo;
said I again, seeing it pleased him. But he didn&rsquo;t
answer. I heard the girl giggle outside the door, for
occasionally we&rsquo;d had just a bit of innocent laughter,
you know, at his ways. I looked at his face, and his
eyes were closed, and it was just as if somebody had
punched in his nose on either side. But he was still
smiling. It&rsquo;s queer to think of&mdash;he lay dead, lay dead
there, an utter failure, with the smile of success on his
face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was the end of my uncle. You can imagine
me and my mother saw that he had a decent funeral.
Then, of course, came the hunt for the will. We
began decent and respectful at first, and before the
day was out we were ripping chairs, and smashing
bureau panels, and sounding walls. Every hour we
expected those others to come in. We asked the
housekeeper, and found she&rsquo;d actually witnessed a
will&mdash;on an ordinary half-sheet of notepaper it was
written, and very short, she said&mdash;not a month ago.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
The other witness was the gardener, and he bore her
out word for word. But I&rsquo;m hanged if there was that
or any other will to be found. The way my mother
talked must have made him turn in his grave. At
last a lawyer at Reigate sprang one on us that had
been made years ago during some temporary quarrel
with my mother. I&rsquo;m blest if that wasn&rsquo;t the only
will to be discovered anywhere, and it left every
penny he possessed to that &lsquo;Take &rsquo;im away&rsquo;
youngster of his second cousin&rsquo;s&mdash;a chap who&rsquo;d never
had to stand his talking not for one afternoon of
his life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man with the glass eye stopped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you said&rdquo;&mdash;I began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Half a minute,&rdquo; said the man with the glass eye.
&ldquo;<em>I</em> had to wait for the end of the story till this very
morning, and I was a blessed sight more interested
than you are. You just wait a bit too. They
executed the will, and the other chap inherited, and
directly he was one-and-twenty he began to blew it.
How he did blew it, to be sure! He bet, he drank,
he got in the papers for this and that. I tell you, it
makes me wriggle to think of the times he had. He
blewed every ha&rsquo;penny of it before he was thirty,
and the last I heard of him was&mdash;Holloway! Three
years ago.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I naturally fell on hard times, because, as
you see, the only trade I knew was legacy-cadging.
All my plans were waiting over to begin, so to speak,
when the old chap died. I&rsquo;ve had my ups and downs
since then. Just now it&rsquo;s a period of depression. I
tell you frankly, I&rsquo;m on the look-out for help. I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
hunting round my room to find something to raise a
bit on for immediate necessities, and the sight of all
those presentation volumes&mdash;no one will buy them,
not to wrap butter in, even&mdash;well, they annoyed me.
I&rsquo;d promised him not to part with them, and I never
kept a promise easier. I let out at them with my
boot, and sent them shooting across the room. One
lifted at the kick, and spun through the air. And out
of it flapped&mdash;You guess?</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was the will. He&rsquo;d given it me himself in that
very last volume of all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He folded his arms on the table, and looked sadly
with the active eye at his empty tankard. He shook
his head slowly, and said softly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d never <em>opened</em> the
book, much more cut a page!&rdquo; Then he looked up,
with a bitter laugh, for my sympathy. &ldquo;Fancy
hiding it there! Eigh? Of all places.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He began to fish absently for a dead fly with his
finger. &ldquo;It just shows you the vanity of authors,&rdquo; he
said, looking up at me. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t no trick of his.
He&rsquo;d meant perfectly fair. He&rsquo;d really thought I
was really going home to read that blessed book of
his through. But it shows you, don&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;&mdash;his eye
went down to the tankard again,&mdash;&ldquo;It shows you, too,
how we poor human beings fail to understand one
another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But there was no misunderstanding the eloquent
thirst of his eye. He accepted with ill-feigned
surprise. He said, in the usual subtle formula, that
he didn&rsquo;t mind if he did.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_SAD_STORY_OF_A_DRAMATIC_CRITIC" id="THE_SAD_STORY_OF_A_DRAMATIC_CRITIC">THE SAD STORY OF A DRAMATIC
CRITIC</a></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">I was</span>&mdash;you shall hear immediately why I am not
now&mdash;Egbert Craddock Cummins. The name
remains. I am still (Heaven help me!) Dramatic
Critic to the <cite>Fiery Cross</cite>. What I shall be in a little
while I do not know. I write in great trouble and
confusion of mind. I will do what I can to make
myself clear in the face of terrible difficulties. You
must bear with me a little. When a man is rapidly
losing his own identity, he naturally finds a difficulty
in expressing himself. I will make it perfectly plain in
a minute, when once I get my grip upon the story.
Let me see&mdash;where <em>am</em> I? I wish I knew. Ah, I have
it! Dead self! Egbert Craddock Cummins!</p>

<p>In the past I should have disliked writing anything
quite so full of &ldquo;I&rdquo; as this story must be. It is full
of &ldquo;I&rsquo;s&rdquo; before and behind, like the beast in Revelation&mdash;the
one with a head like a calf, I am afraid.
But my tastes have changed since I became a
Dramatic Critic and studied the masters&mdash;G.R.S.,
G.B.S., G.A.S., and the others. Everything has
changed since then. At least the story is about
myself&mdash;so that there is some excuse for me. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
it is really not egotism, because, as I say, since
those days my identity has undergone an entire
alteration.</p>

<p>That past!... I was&mdash;in those days&mdash;rather a
nice fellow, rather shy&mdash;taste for grey in my clothes,
weedy little moustache, face &ldquo;interesting,&rdquo; slight
stutter which I had caught in early life from a schoolfellow.
Engaged to a very nice girl, named Delia.
Fairly new, she was&mdash;cigarettes&mdash;liked me because
I was human and original. Considered I was like
Lamb&mdash;on the strength of the stutter, I believe.
Father, an eminent authority on postage stamps.
She read a great deal in the British Museum. (A
perfect pairing ground for literary people, that British
Museum&mdash;you should read George Egerton and
Justin Huntly M&rsquo;Carthy and Gissing and the rest of
them.) We loved in our intellectual way, and shared
the brightest hopes. (All gone now.) And her
father liked me because I seemed honestly eager to
hear about stamps. She had no mother. Indeed,
I had the happiest prospects a young man could have.
I never went to theatres in those days. My Aunt
Charlotte before she died had told me not to.</p>

<p>Then Barnaby, the editor of the <cite>Fiery Cross</cite>, made
me&mdash;in spite of my spasmodic efforts to escape&mdash;Dramatic
Critic. He is a fine, healthy man, Barnaby,
with an enormous head of frizzy black hair and a
convincing manner, and he caught me on the staircase
going to see Wembly. He had been dining,
and was more than usually buoyant. &ldquo;Hullo, Cummins!&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;The very man I want!&rdquo; He
caught me by the shoulder or the collar or something,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
ran me up the little passage, and flung me over the
waste-paper basket into the arm-chair in his office.
&ldquo;Pray be seated,&rdquo; he said, as he did so. Then he
ran across the room and came back with some pink
and yellow tickets and pushed them into my hand.
&ldquo;Opera Comique,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Thursday; Friday, the
Surrey; Saturday, the Frivolity. That&rsquo;s all, I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&rdquo;&mdash;I began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Glad you&rsquo;re free,&rdquo; he said, snatching some proofs
off the desk and beginning to read.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite understand,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Eigh?</em>&rdquo; he said, at the top of his voice, as though
he thought I had gone, and was startled at my
remark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you want me to criticise these plays?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do something with &rsquo;em.... Did you think it
was a treat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you call me a fool?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve never been to a theatre in my life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Virgin soil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t know anything about it, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it. New view. No habits. No
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">clichés</i> in stock. Ours is a live paper, not a bag
of tricks. None of your clockwork professional
journalism in this office. And I can rely on your
integrity&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve conscientious scruples&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>He caught me up suddenly and put me outside his
door. &ldquo;Go and talk to Wembly about that,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll explain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As I stood perplexed, he opened the door again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
said, &ldquo;I forgot this,&rdquo; thrust a fourth ticket into my
hand (it was for that night&mdash;in twenty minutes&rsquo; time),
and slammed the door upon me. His expression was
quite calm, but I caught his eye.</p>

<p>I hate arguments. I decided that I would take his
hint and become (to my own destruction) a Dramatic
Critic. I walked slowly down the passage to Wembly.
That Barnaby has a remarkably persuasive way. He
has made few suggestions during our very pleasant
intercourse of four years that he has not ultimately
won me round to adopting. It may be, of course,
that I am of a yielding disposition; certainly I am
too apt to take my colour from my circumstances.
It is, indeed, to my unfortunate susceptibility to vivid
impressions that all my misfortunes are due. I have
already alluded to the slight stammer I had acquired
from a schoolfellow in my youth. However, this is a
digression.... I went home in a cab to dress.</p>

<p>I will not trouble the reader with my thoughts
about the first-night audience, strange assembly as it is,&mdash;those
I reserve for my Memoirs,&mdash;nor the humiliating
story of how I got lost during the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entr&rsquo;acte</i> in a
lot of red plush passages, and saw the third act from
the gallery. The only point upon which I wish to
lay stress was the remarkable effect of the acting
upon me. You must remember I had lived a quiet
and retired life, and had never been to the theatre
before, and that I am extremely sensitive to vivid
impressions. At the risk of repetition I must insist
upon these points.</p>

<p>The first effect was a profound amazement, not
untinctured by alarm. The phenomenal unnaturalness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
of acting is a thing discounted in the minds of
most people by early visits to the theatre. They
get used to the fantastic gestures, the flamboyant
emotions, the weird mouthings, melodious snortings,
agonising yelps, lip-gnawings, glaring horrors, and
other emotional symbolism of the stage. It becomes
at last a mere deaf-and-dumb language to them,
which they read intelligently <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pari passu</i> with the
hearing of the dialogue. But all this was new to
me. The thing was called a modern comedy, the
people were supposed to be English and were dressed
like fashionable Americans of the current epoch, and
I fell into the natural error of supposing that the
actors were trying to represent human beings. I
looked round on my first-night audience with a kind
of wonder, discovered&mdash;as all new Dramatic Critics
do&mdash;that it rested with me to reform the Drama, and,
after a supper choked with emotion, went off to the
office to write a column, piebald with &ldquo;new paragraphs&rdquo;
(as all my stuff is&mdash;it fills out so) and
purple with indignation. Barnaby was delighted.</p>

<p>But I could not sleep that night. I dreamt of
actors&mdash;actors glaring, actors smiting their chests,
actors flinging out a handful of extended fingers,
actors smiling bitterly, laughing despairingly, falling
hopelessly, dying idiotically. I got up at eleven
with a slight headache, read my notice in the <cite>Fiery
Cross</cite>, breakfasted, and went back to my room to
shave. (It&rsquo;s my habit to do so.) Then an odd thing
happened. I could not find my razor. Suddenly it
occurred to me that I had not unpacked it the day
before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said I, in front of the looking-glass. Then
&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Quite involuntarily, when I had thought of my
portmanteau, I had flung up the left arm (fingers
fully extended) and clutched at my diaphragm with
my right hand. I am an acutely self-conscious man
at all times. The gesture struck me as absolutely
novel for me. I repeated it, for my own satisfaction.
&ldquo;Odd!&rdquo; Then (rather puzzled) I turned to my
portmanteau.</p>

<p>After shaving, my mind reverted to the acting I
had seen, and I entertained myself before the cheval
glass with some imitations of Jafferay&rsquo;s more exaggerated
gestures. &ldquo;Really, one might think it a
disease,&rdquo; I said&mdash;&ldquo;Stage-Walkitis!&rdquo; (There&rsquo;s many
a truth spoken in jest.) Then, if I remember rightly,
I went off to see Wembly, and afterwards lunched at
the British Museum with Delia. We actually spoke
about our prospects, in the light of my new appointment.</p>

<p>But that appointment was the beginning of my
downfall. From that day I necessarily became a
persistent theatre-goer, and almost insensibly I
began to change. The next thing I noticed after
the gesture about the razor, was to catch myself
bowing ineffably when I met Delia, and stooping
in an old-fashioned, courtly way over her hand.
Directly I caught myself, I straightened myself up
and became very uncomfortable. I remember she
looked at me curiously. Then, in the office, I found
myself doing &ldquo;nervous business,&rdquo; fingers on teeth,
when Barnaby asked me a question I could not very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
well answer. Then, in some trifling difference with
Delia, I clasped my hand to my brow. And I
pranced through my social transactions at times
singularly like an actor! I tried not to&mdash;no one
could be more keenly alive to the arrant absurdity
of the histrionic bearing. And I did!</p>

<p>It began to dawn on me what it all meant. The
acting, I saw, was too much for my delicately-strung
nervous system. I have always, I know, been too
amenable to the suggestions of my circumstances.
Night after night of concentrated attention to the
conventional attitudes and intonation of the English
stage was gradually affecting my speech and carriage.
I was giving way to the infection of sympathetic
imitation. Night after night my plastic nervous
system took the print of some new amazing gesture,
some new emotional exaggeration&mdash;and retained it.
A kind of theatrical veneer threatened to plate over
and obliterate my private individuality altogether.
I saw myself in a kind of vision. Sitting by myself
one night, my new self seemed to me to glide, posing
and gesticulating, across the room. He clutched his
throat, he opened his fingers, he opened his legs in
walking like a high-class marionette. He went from
attitude to attitude. He might have been clockwork.
Directly after this I made an ineffectual attempt to
resign my theatrical work. But Barnaby persisted
in talking about the Polywhiddle Divorce all the
time I was with him, and I could get no opportunity
of saying what I wished.</p>

<p>And then Delia&rsquo;s manner began to change towards
me. The ease of our intercourse vanished. I felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
she was learning to dislike me. I grinned, and
capered, and scowled, and posed at her in a thousand
ways, and knew&mdash;with what a voiceless agony!&mdash;that
I did it all the time. I tried to resign again,
and Barnaby talked about &ldquo;X&rdquo; and &ldquo;Z&rdquo; and &ldquo;Y&rdquo;
in the <cite>New Review</cite>, and gave me a strong cigar to
smoke, and so routed me. And then I walked up
the Assyrian Gallery in the manner of Irving to
meet Delia, and so precipitated the crisis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&mdash;<em>Dear!</em>&rdquo; I said, with more sprightliness and
emotion in my voice than had ever been in all my
life before I became (to my own undoing) a Dramatic
Critic.</p>

<p>She held out her hand rather coldly, scrutinising
my face as she did so. I prepared, with a new-won
grace, to walk by her side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Egbert,&rdquo; she said, standing still, and thought.
Then she looked at me.</p>

<p>I said nothing. I felt what was coming. I tried to
be the old Egbert Craddock Cummins of shambling
gait and stammering sincerity, whom she loved, but
I felt even as I did so that I was a new thing, a
thing of surging emotions and mysterious fixity&mdash;like
no human being that ever lived, except upon the
stage. &ldquo;Egbert,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you are not yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Involuntarily I clutched my diaphragm
and averted my head (as is the way with them).</p>

<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>What do you mean?</em>&rdquo; I said, whispering in vocal
italics&mdash;you know how they do it&mdash;turning on her,
perplexity on face, right hand down, left on brow.
I knew quite well what she meant. I knew quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
well the dramatic unreality of my behaviour. But I
struggled against it in vain. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
I said, and, in a kind of hoarse whisper, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
understand!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She really looked as though she disliked me.
&ldquo;What do you keep on posing for?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t like it. You didn&rsquo;t use to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t use to!&rdquo; I said slowly, repeating this
twice. I glared up and down the gallery, with short,
sharp glances. &ldquo;We are alone,&rdquo; I said swiftly.
&ldquo;<em>Listen!</em>&rdquo; I poked my forefinger towards her, and
glared at her. &ldquo;I am under a curse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I saw her hand tighten upon her sunshade. &ldquo;You
are under some bad influence or other,&rdquo; said Delia.
&ldquo;You should give it up. I never knew anyone
change as you have done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Delia!&rdquo; I said, lapsing into the pathetic. &ldquo;Pity
me. Augh! Delia! <em>Pit</em>&mdash;y me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She eyed me critically. &ldquo;<em>Why</em> you keep playing
the fool like this I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Anyhow,
I really cannot go about with a man who behaves as
you do. You made us both ridiculous on Wednesday.
Frankly, I dislike you, as you are now. I met
you here to tell you so&mdash;as it&rsquo;s about the only place
where we can be sure of being alone together&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Delia!&rdquo; said I, with intensity, knuckles of clenched
hands white. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said Delia. &ldquo;A woman&rsquo;s lot is sad enough
at the best of times. But with you&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>I clapped my hand on my brow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, good-bye,&rdquo; said Delia, without emotion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Delia!&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Not <em>this</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Mr. Cummins,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>By a violent effort I controlled myself and touched
her hand. I tried to say some word of explanation
to her. She looked into my working face and
winced. &ldquo;I <em>must</em> do it,&rdquo; she said hopelessly. Then
she turned from me and began walking rapidly down
the gallery.</p>

<p>Heavens! How the human agony cried within
me! I loved Delia. But nothing found expression&mdash;I
was already too deeply crusted with my acquired
self.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-baye!&rdquo; I said at last, watching her retreating
figure. How I hated myself for doing it! After
she had vanished, I repeated in a dreamy way,
&ldquo;Good-baye!&rdquo; looking hopelessly round me. Then,
with a kind of heart-broken cry, I shook my clenched
fists in the air, staggered to the pedestal of a winged
figure, buried my face in my arms, and made my
shoulders heave. Something within me said &ldquo;Ass!&rdquo;
as I did so. (I had the greatest difficulty in persuading
the Museum policeman, who was attracted
by my cry of agony, that I was not intoxicated, but
merely suffering from a transient indisposition.)</p>

<p>But even this great sorrow has not availed to save
me from my fate. I see it, everyone sees it; I grow
more &ldquo;theatrical&rdquo; every day. And no one could be
more painfully aware of the pungent silliness of
theatrical ways. The quiet, nervous, but pleasing
E.&nbsp;C. Cummins vanishes. I cannot save him. I am
driven like a dead leaf before the winds of March.
My tailor even enters into the spirit of my disorder.
He has a peculiar sense of what is fitting. I tried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
to get a dull grey suit from him this spring, and
he foisted a brilliant blue upon me, and I see he
has put braid down the sides of my new dress
trousers. My hairdresser insists upon giving me a
&ldquo;wave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I am beginning to associate with actors. I detest
them, but it is only in their company that I can feel
I am not glaringly conspicuous. Their talk infects
me. I notice a growing tendency to dramatic brevity,
to dashes and pauses in my style, to a punctuation of
bows and attitudes. Barnaby has remarked it too.
I offended Wembly by calling him &ldquo;Dear Boy&rdquo;
yesterday. I dread the end, but I cannot escape
from it.</p>

<p>The fact is, I am being obliterated. Living a grey,
retired life all my youth, I came to the theatre a
delicate sketch of a man, a thing of tints and faint
lines. Their gorgeous colouring has effaced me
altogether. People forget how much mode of expression,
method of movement, are a matter of
contagion. I have heard of stage-struck people
before, and thought it a figure of speech. I spoke
of it jestingly, as a disease. It is no jest. It <em>is</em> a
disease. And I have got it bad! Deep down within
me I protest against the wrong done to my personality&mdash;unavailingly.
For three hours or more a
week I have to go and concentrate my attention on
some fresh play, and the suggestions of the drama
strengthen their awful hold upon me. My manners
grow so flamboyant, my passions so professional,
that I doubt, as I said at the outset, whether it is
really myself that behaves in such a manner. I feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
merely the core to this dramatic casing, that grows
thicker and presses upon me&mdash;me and mine. I feel
like King John&rsquo;s abbot in his cope of lead.</p>

<p>I doubt, indeed, whether I should not abandon the
struggle altogether&mdash;leave this sad world of ordinary
life for which I am so ill-fitted, abandon the name of
Cummins for some professional pseudonym, complete
my self-effacement, and&mdash;a thing of tricks and tatters,
of posing and pretence&mdash;go upon the stage. It seems
my only resort&mdash;&ldquo;to hold the mirror up to Nature.&rdquo;
For in the ordinary life, I will confess, no one now
seems to regard me as both sane and sober. Only
upon the stage, I feel convinced, will people take me
seriously. That will be the end of it. I <em>know</em> that
will be the end of it. And yet ... I will frankly
confess ... all that marks off your actor from your
common man ... I <em>detest</em>. I am still largely of my
Aunt Charlotte&rsquo;s opinion, that playacting is unworthy
of a pure-minded man&rsquo;s attention, much more participation.
Even now I would resign my dramatic
criticism and try a rest. Only I can&rsquo;t get hold of
Barnaby. Letters of resignation he never notices.
He says it is against the etiquette of journalism to
write to your Editor. And when I go to see him, he
gives me another big cigar and some strong whisky
and soda, and then something always turns up to
prevent my explanation.</p>

<h2><a name="A_SLIP_UNDER_THE_MICROSCOPE" id="A_SLIP_UNDER_THE_MICROSCOPE">A SLIP UNDER THE MICROSCOPE</a></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Outside</span> the laboratory windows was a watery-grey
fog, and within a close warmth and the
yellow light of the green-shaded gas lamps
that stood two to each table down its narrow length.
On each table stood a couple of glass jars containing
the mangled vestiges of the crayfish, mussels, frogs,
and guineapigs, upon which the students had been
working, and down the side of the room, facing the
windows, were shelves bearing bleached dissections
in spirits, surmounted by a row of beautifully executed
anatomical drawings in whitewood frames and overhanging
a row of cubical lockers. All the doors of
the laboratory were panelled with blackboard, and on
these were the half-erased diagrams of the previous
day&rsquo;s work. The laboratory was empty, save for the
demonstrator, who sat near the preparation-room
door, and silent, save for a low, continuous murmur,
and the clicking of the rocker microtome at which he
was working. But scattered about the room were
traces of numerous students: hand-bags, polished
boxes of instruments, in one place a large drawing
covered by newspaper, and in another a prettily bound
copy of <cite>News from Nowhere</cite>, a book oddly at variance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
with its surroundings. These things had been put
down hastily as the students had arrived and hurried
at once to secure their seats in the adjacent lecture
theatre. Deadened by the closed door, the measured
accents of the professor sounded as a featureless
muttering.</p>

<p>Presently, faint through the closed windows came
the sound of the Oratory clock striking the hour of
eleven. The clicking of the microtome ceased, and
the demonstrator looked at his watch, rose, thrust his
hands into his pockets, and walked slowly down the
laboratory towards the lecture theatre door. He
stood listening for a moment, and then his eye fell on
the little volume by William Morris. He picked
it up, glanced at the title, smiled, opened it, looked at
the name on the fly-leaf, ran the leaves through with
his hand, and put it down. Almost immediately the
even murmur of the lecturer ceased, there was a
sudden burst of pencils rattling on the desks in the
lecture theatre, a stirring, a scraping of feet, and a
number of voices speaking together. Then a firm
footfall approached the door, which began to open,
and stood ajar, as some indistinctly heard question
arrested the new-comer.</p>

<p>The demonstrator turned, walked slowly back
past the microtome, and left the laboratory by the
preparation-room door. As he did so, first one, and
then several students carrying notebooks entered the
laboratory from the lecture theatre, and distributed
themselves among the little tables, or stood in a
group about the doorway. They were an exceptionally
heterogeneous assembly, for while Oxford and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
Cambridge still recoil from the blushing prospect of
mixed classes, the College of Science anticipated
America in the matter years ago&mdash;mixed socially,
too, for the prestige of the College is high, and its
scholarships, free of any age limit, dredge deeper even
than do those of the Scotch universities. The class
numbered one-and-twenty, but some remained in the
theatre questioning the professor, copying the blackboard
diagrams before they were washed off, or
examining the special specimens he had produced
to illustrate the day&rsquo;s teaching. Of the nine who had
come into the laboratory three were girls, one of
whom, a little fair woman, wearing spectacles and
dressed in greyish-green, was peering out of the
window at the fog, while the other two, both
wholesome-looking, plain-faced schoolgirls, unrolled
and put on the brown holland aprons they wore while
dissecting. Of the men, two went down the laboratory
to their places, one a pallid, dark-bearded man,
who had once been a tailor; the other a pleasant-featured,
ruddy young man of twenty, dressed
in a well-fitting brown suit; young Wedderburn,
the son of Wedderburn the eye specialist. The
others formed a little knot near the theatre door.
One of these, a dwarfed, spectacled figure, with a
hunch back, sat on a bent wood stool; two others,
one a short, dark youngster, and the other a flaxen-haired,
reddish-complexioned young man, stood leaning
side by side against the slate sink, while the fourth
stood facing them, and maintained the larger share of
the conversation.</p>

<p>This last person was named Hill. He was a sturdily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
built young fellow, of the same age as Wedderburn;
he had a white face, dark grey eyes, hair of an indeterminate
colour, and prominent, irregular features.
He talked rather louder than was needful, and thrust
his hands deeply into his pockets. His collar was
frayed and blue with the starch of a careless laundress,
his clothes were evidently readymade, and there was
a patch on the side of his boot near the toe. And as
he talked or listened to the others, he glanced now
and again towards the lecture theatre door. They
were discussing the depressing peroration of the
lecture they had just heard, the last lecture it was
in the introductory course in zoology. &ldquo;From ovum
to ovum is the goal of the higher vertebrata,&rdquo; the
lecturer had said in his melancholy tones, and so had
neatly rounded off the sketch of comparative anatomy
he had been developing. The spectacled hunchback
had repeated it, with noisy appreciation, had tossed
it towards the fair-haired student with an evident
provocation, and had started one of those vague,
rambling discussions on generalities, so unaccountably
dear to the student mind all the world
over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is our goal, perhaps&mdash;I admit it&mdash;as far as
science goes,&rdquo; said the fair-haired student, rising to
the challenge. &ldquo;But there are things above science.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Science,&rdquo; said Hill confidently, &ldquo;is systematic
knowledge. Ideas that don&rsquo;t come into the system&mdash;must
anyhow&mdash;be loose ideas.&rdquo; He was not quite
sure whether that was a clever saying or a fatuity
until his hearers took it seriously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The thing I cannot understand,&rdquo; said the hunchback,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
at large, &ldquo;is whether Hill is a materialist or
not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is one thing above matter,&rdquo; said Hill
promptly, feeling he had a better thing this time,
aware, too, of someone in the doorway behind him,
and raising his voice a trifle for her benefit, &ldquo;and
that is, the delusion that there is something above
matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So we have your gospel at last,&rdquo; said the fair
student. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all a delusion, is it? All our aspirations
to lead something more than dogs&rsquo; lives, all our
work for anything beyond ourselves. But see how
inconsistent you are. Your socialism, for instance.
Why do you trouble about the interests of the race?
Why do you concern yourself about the beggar
in the gutter? Why are you bothering yourself
to lend that book&rdquo;&mdash;he indicated William Morris
by a movement of the head&mdash;&ldquo;to everyone in the
lab.?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Girl,&rdquo; said the hunchback indistinctly, and glanced
guiltily over his shoulder.</p>

<p>The girl in brown, with the brown eyes, had come
into the laboratory, and stood on the other side of the
table behind him, with her rolled-up apron in one
hand, looking over her shoulder, listening to the discussion.
She did not notice the hunchback, because
she was glancing from Hill to his interlocutor. Hill&rsquo;s
consciousness of her presence betrayed itself to her
only in his studious ignorance of the fact; but she
understood that, and it pleased her. &ldquo;I see no
reason,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;why a man should live like a
brute because he knows of nothing beyond matter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
and does not expect to exist a hundred years
hence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; said the fair-haired
student.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why <em>should</em> he?&rdquo; said Hill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What inducement has he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way with all you religious people.
It&rsquo;s all a business of inducements. Cannot a man
seek after righteousness for righteousness&rsquo; sake?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a pause. The fair man answered, with a
kind of vocal padding, &ldquo;But&mdash;you see&mdash;inducement&mdash;when
I said inducement,&rdquo; to gain time. And then
the hunchback came to his rescue and inserted a
question. He was a terrible person in the debating
society with his questions, and they invariably took
one form&mdash;a demand for a definition. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your
definition of righteousness?&rdquo; said the hunchback at
this stage.</p>

<p>Hill experienced a sudden loss of complacency at
this question, but even as it was asked, relief came
in the person of Brooks, the laboratory attendant,
who entered by the preparation-room door, carrying
a number of freshly killed guineapigs by their hind
legs. &ldquo;This is the last batch of material this session,&rdquo;
said the youngster, who had not previously spoken.
Brooks advanced up the laboratory, smacking down
a couple of guineapigs at each table. The rest of
the class, scenting the prey from afar, came crowding
in by the lecture theatre door, and the discussion
perished abruptly as the students who were not
already in their places hurried to them to secure the
choice of a specimen. There was a noise of keys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
rattling on split rings as lockers were opened and
dissecting instruments taken out. Hill was already
standing by his table, and his box of scalpels was
sticking out of his pocket. The girl in brown came
a step towards him, and, leaning over his table, said
softly, &ldquo;Did you see that I returned your book,
Mr. Hill?&rdquo;</p>

<p>During the whole scene she and the book had been
vividly present in his consciousness; but he made a
clumsy pretence of looking at the book and seeing it
for the first time. &ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; he said, taking it up.
&ldquo;I see. Did you like it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to ask you some questions about it&mdash;some
time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Hill. &ldquo;I shall be glad.&rdquo; He
stopped awkwardly. &ldquo;You liked it?&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wonderful book. Only some things I don&rsquo;t
understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then suddenly the laboratory was hushed by a
curious braying noise. It was the demonstrator.
He was at the blackboard ready to begin the day&rsquo;s
instruction, and it was his custom to demand silence
by a sound midway between the &ldquo;Er&rdquo; of common
intercourse and the blast of a trumpet. The girl in
brown slipped back to her place: it was immediately
in front of Hill&rsquo;s, and Hill, forgetting her forthwith,
took a notebook out of the drawer of his table,
turned over its leaves hastily, drew a stumpy pencil
from his pocket, and prepared to make a copious
note of the coming demonstration. For demonstrations
and lectures are the sacred text of the
College students. Books, saving only the Professor&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
own, you may&mdash;it is even expedient to&mdash;ignore.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>Hill was the son of a Landport cobbler, and had
been hooked by a chance blue paper the authorities
had thrown out to the Landport Technical College.
He kept himself in London on his allowance of a
guinea a week, and found that, with proper care, this
also covered his clothing allowance, an occasional
waterproof collar, that is; and ink and needles and
cotton, and such-like necessaries for a man about town.
This was his first year and his first session, but the
brown old man in Landport had already got himself
detested in many public-houses by boasting of his
son, &ldquo;the Professor.&rdquo; Hill was a vigorous youngster,
with a serene contempt for the clergy of all denominations,
and a fine ambition to reconstruct the world.
He regarded his scholarship as a brilliant opportunity.
He had begun to read at seven, and had
read steadily whatever came in his way, good or bad,
since then. His worldly experience had been limited
to the island of Portsea, and acquired chiefly in the
wholesale boot factory in which he had worked by
day, after passing the seventh standard of the Board
school. He had a considerable gift of speech, as the
College Debating Society, which met amidst the
crushing machines and mine models in the metallurgical
theatre downstairs, already recognised&mdash;recognised
by a violent battering of desks whenever he
rose. And he was just at that fine emotional age
when life opens at the end of a narrow pass like a
broad valley at one&rsquo;s feet, full of the promise of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
wonderful discoveries and tremendous achievements.
And his own limitations, save that he knew that he
knew neither Latin nor French, were all unknown
to him.</p>

<p>At first his interest had been divided pretty equally
between his biological work at the College and social
and theological theorising, an employment which he
took in deadly earnest. Of a night, when the big
museum library was not open, he would sit on the
bed of his room in Chelsea with his coat and a muffler
on, and write out the lecture notes and revise his
dissection memoranda, until Thorpe called him out
by a whistle,&mdash;the landlady objected to open the door
to attic visitors,&mdash;and then the two would go prowling
about the shadowy, shiny, gas-lit streets, talking, very
much in the fashion of the sample just given, of the
God Idea, and Righteousness, and Carlyle, and the
Reorganisation of Society. And, in the midst of it
all, Hill, arguing not only for Thorpe, but for the
casual passer-by, would lose the thread of his argument
glancing at some pretty painted face that looked
meaningly at him as he passed. Science and Righteousness!
But once or twice lately there had been
signs that a third interest was creeping into his life,
and he had found his attention wandering from the
fate of the mesoblastic somites or the probable meaning
of the blastopore, to the thought of the girl with
the brown eyes who sat at the table before him.</p>

<p>She was a paying student; she descended inconceivable
social altitudes to speak to him. At the
thought of the education she must have had, and the
accomplishments she must possess, the soul of Hill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
became abject within him. She had spoken to him
first over a difficulty about the alisphenoid of a
rabbit&rsquo;s skull, and he had found that, in biology at
least, he had no reason for self-abasement. And
from that, after the manner of young people starting
from any starting-point, they got to generalities, and
while Hill attacked her upon the question of socialism,&mdash;some
instinct told him to spare her a direct assault
upon her religion,&mdash;she was gathering resolution to
undertake what she told herself was his æsthetic education.
She was a year or two older than he, though
the thought never occurred to him. The loan of
<cite>News from Nowhere</cite> was the beginning of a series of
cross loans. Upon some absurd first principle of his,
Hill had never &ldquo;wasted time&rdquo; upon poetry, and it
seemed an appalling deficiency to her. One day in
the lunch hour, when she chanced upon him alone in
the little museum where the skeletons were arranged,
shamefully eating the bun that constituted his midday
meal, she retreated, and returned to lend him,
with a slightly furtive air, a volume of Browning.
He stood sideways towards her and took the book
rather clumsily, because he was holding the bun in
the other hand. And in the retrospect his voice
lacked the cheerful clearness he could have wished.</p>

<p>That occurred after the examination in comparative
anatomy, on the day before the College turned out its
students, and was carefully locked up by the officials,
for the Christmas holidays. The excitement of cramming
for the first trial of strength had for a little
while dominated Hill, to the exclusion of his other
interests. In the forecasts of the result in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
everyone indulged, he was surprised to find that no
one regarded him as a possible competitor for the
Harvey Commemoration Medal, of which this and
the two subsequent examinations disposed. It was
about this time that Wedderburn, who so far had
lived inconspicuously on the uttermost margin of
Hill&rsquo;s perceptions, began to take on the appearance
of an obstacle. By a mutual agreement, the nocturnal
prowlings with Thorpe ceased for the three weeks
before the examination, and his landlady pointed out
that she really could not supply so much lamp oil at
the price. He walked to and fro from the College
with little slips of mnemonics in his hand, lists of
crayfish appendages, rabbits&rsquo; skull-bones, and vertebrate
nerves, for example, and became a positive
nuisance to foot passengers in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>But, by a natural reaction, Poetry and the girl with
the brown eyes ruled the Christmas holiday. The
pending results of the examination became such a
secondary consideration that Hill marvelled at his
father&rsquo;s excitement. Even had he wished it, there
was no comparative anatomy to read in Landport,
and he was too poor to buy books, but the stock of
poets in the library was extensive, and Hill&rsquo;s attack
was magnificently sustained. He saturated himself
with the fluent numbers of Longfellow and Tennyson,
and fortified himself with Shakespeare; found a
kindred soul in Pope, and a master in Shelley, and
heard and fled the siren voices of Eliza Cook and
Mrs. Hemans. But he read no more Browning,
because he hoped for the loan of other volumes from
Miss Haysman when he returned to London.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>He walked from his lodgings to the College with
that volume of Browning in his shiny black bag, and
his mind teeming with the finest general propositions
about poetry. Indeed, he framed first this little
speech and then that with which to grace the return.
The morning was an exceptionally pleasant one for
London; there was a clear, hard frost and undeniable
blue in the sky, a thin haze softened every outline,
and warm shafts of sunlight struck between the house
blocks and turned the sunny side of the street to
amber and gold. In the hall of the College he pulled
off his glove and signed his name with fingers so stiff
with cold that the characteristic dash under the signature
he cultivated became a quivering line. He
imagined Miss Haysman about him everywhere.
He turned at the staircase, and there, below, he saw
a crowd struggling at the foot of the notice-board.
This, possibly, was the biology list. He forgot
Browning and Miss Haysman for the moment, and
joined the scrimmage. And at last, with his cheek
flattened against the sleeve of the man on the step
above him, he read the list&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<p class="cls">CLASS I</p>

<ul class="lsoff">
<li>H. J. Somers Wedderburn</li>
<li>William Hill</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p class="noi">and thereafter followed a second class that is outside
our present sympathies. It was characteristic that he
did not trouble to look for Thorpe on the physics
list, but backed out of the struggle at once, and in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
curious emotional state between pride over common
second-class humanity and acute disappointment at
Wedderburn&rsquo;s success, went on his way upstairs. At
the top, as he was hanging up his coat in the passage,
the zoological demonstrator, a young man from
Oxford, who secretly regarded him as a blatant
&ldquo;mugger&rdquo; of the very worst type, offered his heartiest
congratulations.</p>

<p>At the laboratory door Hill stopped for a second
to get his breath, and then entered. He looked
straight up the laboratory and saw all five girl
students grouped in their places, and Wedderburn,
the once retiring Wedderburn, leaning rather gracefully
against the window, playing with the blind
tassel and talking, apparently, to the five of them.
Now, Hill could talk bravely enough and even overbearingly
to one girl, and he could have made a
speech to a roomful of girls, but this business of
standing at ease and appreciating, fencing, and
returning quick remarks round a group was, he knew,
altogether beyond him. Coming up the staircase his
feelings for Wedderburn had been generous, a certain
admiration perhaps, a willingness to shake his hand
conspicuously and heartily as one who had fought but
the first round. But before Christmas Wedderburn
had never gone up to that end of the room to talk.
In a flash Hill&rsquo;s mist of vague excitement condensed
abruptly to a vivid dislike of Wedderburn. Possibly
his expression changed. As he came up to his
place, Wedderburn nodded carelessly to him, and
the others glanced round. Miss Haysman looked
at him and away again, the faintest touch of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
eyes. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t agree with you, Mr. Wedderburn,&rdquo;
she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must congratulate you on your first class, Mr.
Hill,&rdquo; said the spectacled girl in green, turning round
and beaming at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; said Hill, staring at Wedderburn
and Miss Haysman talking together, and eager to
hear what they talked about.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We poor folks in the second class don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo;
said the girl in spectacles.</p>

<p>What was it Wedderburn was saying? Something
about William Morris! Hill did not answer the girl
in spectacles, and the smile died out of his face. He
could not hear, and failed to see how he could &ldquo;cut
in.&rdquo; Confound Wedderburn! He sat down, opened
his bag, hesitated whether to return the volume of
Browning forthwith, in the sight of all, and instead
drew out his new notebooks for the short course in
elementary botany that was now beginning, and
which would terminate in February. As he did so,
a fat, heavy man, with a white face and pale grey
eyes, Bindon, the professor of botany, who came up
from Kew for January and February, came in by the
lecture theatre door, and passed, rubbing his hands
together and smiling, in silent affability down the
laboratory.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>In the subsequent six weeks Hill experienced some
very rapid and curiously complex emotional developments.
For the most part he had Wedderburn in
focus&mdash;a fact that Miss Haysman never suspected.
She told Hill (for in the comparative privacy of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
museum she talked a good deal to him of socialism
and Browning and general propositions) that
she had met Wedderburn at the house of some
people she knew, and &ldquo;he&rsquo;s inherited his cleverness;
for his father, you know, is the great eye
specialist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>My</em> father is a cobbler,&rdquo; said Hill, quite irrelevantly,
and perceived the want of dignity even as he
said it. But the gleam of jealousy did not offend her.
She conceived herself the fundamental source of it.
He suffered bitterly from a sense of Wedderburn&rsquo;s
unfairness, and a realisation of his own handicap.
Here was this Wedderburn had picked up a prominent
man for a father, and instead of his losing so
many marks on the score of that advantage, it was
counted to him for righteousness! And while Hill
had to introduce himself and talk to Miss Haysman
clumsily over mangled guineapigs in the laboratory,
this Wedderburn, in some backstairs way, had access
to her social altitudes, and could converse in a
polished argot that Hill understood perhaps, but felt
incapable of speaking. Not, of course, that he wanted
to. Then it seemed to Hill that for Wedderburn to
come there day after day with cuffs unfrayed, neatly
tailored, precisely barbered, quietly perfect, was in
itself an ill-bred, sneering sort of proceeding. Moreover,
it was a stealthy thing for Wedderburn to behave
insignificantly for a space, to mock modesty, to lead
Hill to fancy that he himself was beyond dispute the
man of the year, and then suddenly to dart in front of
him, and incontinently to swell up in this fashion. In
addition to these things, Wedderburn displayed an increasing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
disposition to join in any conversational grouping
that included Miss Haysman, and would venture,
and indeed seek occasion, to pass opinions derogatory
to socialism and atheism. He goaded Hill to incivilities
by neat, shallow, and exceedingly effective personalities
about the socialist leaders, until Hill hated
Bernard Shaw&rsquo;s graceful egotisms, William Morris&rsquo;s
limited editions and luxurious wall-papers, and Walter
Crane&rsquo;s charmingly absurd ideal working men, about as
much as he hated Wedderburn. The dissertations in
the laboratory, that had been his glory in the previous
term, became a danger, degenerated into inglorious
tussles with Wedderburn, and Hill kept to them only
out of an obscure perception that his honour was
involved. In the debating society Hill knew quite
clearly that, to a thunderous accompaniment of banged
desks, he could have pulverised Wedderburn. Only
Wedderburn never attended the debating society to
be pulverised, because&mdash;nauseous affectation!&mdash;he
&ldquo;dined late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>You must not imagine that these things presented
themselves in quite such a crude form to Hill&rsquo;s perception.
Hill was a born generaliser. Wedderburn to
him was not so much an individual obstacle as a type,
the salient angle of a class. The economic theories
that, after infinite ferment, had shaped themselves in
Hill&rsquo;s mind, became abruptly concrete at the contact.
The world became full of easy-mannered, graceful,
gracefully-dressed, conversationally dexterous, finally
shallow Wedderburns, Bishops Wedderburn, Wedderburn
M.P.&rsquo;s, Professors Wedderburn, Wedderburn
landlords, all with finger-bowl shibboleths and epigrammatic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
cities of refuge from a sturdy debater.
And everyone ill-clothed or ill-dressed, from the
cobbler to the cab-runner, was a man and a brother,
a fellow-sufferer, to Hill&rsquo;s imagination. So that he
became, as it were, a champion of the fallen and
oppressed, albeit to outward seeming only a self-assertive,
ill-mannered young man, and an unsuccessful
champion at that. Again and again a skirmish
over the afternoon tea that the girl students had
inaugurated, left Hill with flushed cheeks and
a tattered temper, and the debating society noticed
a new quality of sarcastic bitterness in his
speeches.</p>

<p>You will understand now how it was necessary, if
only in the interests of humanity, that Hill should
demolish Wedderburn in the forthcoming examination
and outshine him in the eyes of Miss Haysman;
and you will perceive, too, how Miss Haysman fell
into some common feminine misconceptions. The
Hill-Wedderburn quarrel, for in his unostentatious
way Wedderburn reciprocated Hill&rsquo;s ill-veiled rivalry,
became a tribute to her indefinable charm; she was
the Queen of Beauty in a tournament of scalpels and
stumpy pencils. To her confidential friend&rsquo;s secret
annoyance, it even troubled her conscience, for she
was a good girl, and painfully aware, from Ruskin and
contemporary fiction, how entirely men&rsquo;s activities are
determined by women&rsquo;s attitudes. And if Hill never
by any chance mentioned the topic of love to her,
she only credited him with the finer modesty for that
omission.</p>

<p>So the time came on for the second examination,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
and Hill&rsquo;s increasing pallor confirmed the general
rumour that he was working hard. In the aërated
bread shop near South Kensington Station you
would see him, breaking his bun and sipping his
milk, with his eyes intent upon a paper of closely
written notes. In his bedroom there were propositions
about buds and stems round his looking-glass,
a diagram to catch his eye, if soap should chance to
spare it, above his washing basin. He missed several
meetings of the debating society, but he found the
chance encounters with Miss Haysman in the spacious
ways of the adjacent art museum, or in the little
museum at the top of the College, or in the College
corridors, more frequent and very restful. In particular,
they used to meet in a little gallery full of
wrought-iron chests and gates, near the art library,
and there Hill used to talk, under the gentle stimulus
of her flattering attention, of Browning and his
personal ambitions. A characteristic she found
remarkable in him was his freedom from avarice.
He contemplated quite calmly the prospect of living
all his life on an income below a hundred pounds a
year. But he was determined to be famous, to make,
recognisably in his own proper person, the world a
better place to live in. He took Bradlaugh and
John Burns for his leaders and models, poor, even
impecunious, great men. But Miss Haysman thought
that such lives were deficient on the æsthetic side, by
which, though she did not know it, she meant good
wall-paper and upholstery, pretty books, tasteful
clothes, concerts, and meals nicely cooked and
respectfully served.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>At last came the day of the second examination,
and the professor of botany, a fussy, conscientious
man, rearranged all the tables in a long narrow
laboratory to prevent copying, and put his demonstrator
on a chair on a table (where he felt, he said,
like a Hindoo god), to see all the cheating, and stuck a
notice outside the door, &ldquo;Door closed,&rdquo; for no earthly
reason that any human being could discover. And
all the morning from ten till one the quill of Wedderburn
shrieked defiance at Hill&rsquo;s, and the quills of the
others chased their leaders in a tireless pack, and so
also it was in the afternoon. Wedderburn was a
little quieter than usual, and Hill&rsquo;s face was hot all
day, and his overcoat bulged with textbooks and
notebooks against the last moment&rsquo;s revision. And
the next day, in the morning and in the afternoon,
was the practical examination, when sections had to
be cut and slides identified. In the morning Hill
was depressed because he knew he had cut a thick
section, and in the afternoon came the mysterious
slip.</p>

<p>It was just the kind of thing that the botanical
professor was always doing. Like the income tax, it
offered a premium to the cheat. It was a preparation
under the microscope, a little glass slip, held in its
place on the stage of the instrument by light steel
clips, and the inscription set forth that the slip was
not to be moved. Each student was to go in turn to
it, sketch it, write in his book of answers what he
considered it to be, and return to his place. Now, to
move such a slip is a thing one can do by a chance
movement of the finger, and in a fraction of a second.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
The professor&rsquo;s reason for decreeing that the slip
should not be moved depended on the fact that the
object he wanted identified was characteristic of a
certain tree stem. In the position in which it was
placed it was a difficult thing to recognise, but
once the slip was moved so as to bring other parts
of the preparation into view, its nature was obvious
enough.</p>

<p>Hill came to this, flushed from a contest with staining
re-agents, sat down on the little stool before the
microscope, turned the mirror to get the best light,
and then, out of sheer habit, shifted the slip. At
once he remembered the prohibition, and, with
an almost continuous motion of his hands, moved
it back, and sat paralysed with astonishment at his
action.</p>

<p>Then, slowly, he turned his head. The professor
was out of the room; the demonstrator sat aloft on
his impromptu rostrum, reading the <cite>Q. Jour. Mi.
Sci.</cite>; the rest of the examinees were busy, and with
their backs to him. Should he own up to the
accident now? He knew quite clearly what the
thing was. It was a lenticel, a characteristic preparation
from the elder-tree. His eyes roved over his
intent fellow-students, and Wedderburn suddenly
glanced over his shoulder at him with a queer
expression in his eyes. The mental excitement that
had kept Hill at an abnormal pitch of vigour these
two days gave way to a curious nervous tension.
His book of answers was beside him. He did not
write down what the thing was, but with one eye at
the microscope he began making a hasty sketch of it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
His mind was full of this grotesque puzzle in ethics
that had suddenly been sprung upon him. Should
he identify it? or should he leave this question
unanswered? In that case Wedderburn would probably
come out first in the second result. How
could he tell now whether he might not have identified
the thing without shifting it? It was possible
that Wedderburn had failed to recognise it, of course.
Suppose Wedderburn too had shifted the slide? He
looked up at the clock. There were fifteen minutes
in which to make up his mind. He gathered up his
book of answers and the coloured pencils he used
in illustrating his replies, and walked back to his
seat.</p>

<p>He read through his manuscript, and then sat
thinking and gnawing his knuckle. It would look
queer now if he owned up. He <em>must</em> beat Wedderburn.
He forgot the examples of those starry
gentlemen, John Burns and Bradlaugh. Besides, he
reflected, the glimpse of the rest of the slip he had
had was, after all, quite accidental, forced upon him
by chance, a kind of providential revelation rather
than an unfair advantage. It was not nearly so dishonest
to avail himself of that as it was of Broome,
who believed in the efficacy of prayer, to pray
daily for a first-class. &ldquo;Five minutes more,&rdquo; said
the demonstrator, folding up his paper and becoming
observant. Hill watched the clock hands
until two minutes remained; then he opened the
book of answers, and, with hot ears and an affectation
of ease, gave his drawing of the lenticel its
name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>When the second pass list appeared, the previous
positions of Wedderburn and Hill were reversed, and
the spectacled girl in green, who knew the demonstrator
in private life (where he was practically
human), said that in the result of the two examinations
taken together Hill had the advantage of a
mark&mdash;167 to 166 out of a possible 200. Everyone
admired Hill in a way, though the suspicion of
&ldquo;mugging&rdquo; clung to him. But Hill was to find congratulations
and Miss Haysman&rsquo;s enhanced opinion
of him, and even the decided decline in the crest of
Wedderburn, tainted by an unhappy memory. He
felt a remarkable access of energy at first, and the
note of a democracy marching to triumph returned
to his debating society speeches; he worked at his
comparative anatomy with tremendous zeal and
effect, and he went on with his æsthetic education.
But through it all, a vivid little picture was continually
coming before his mind&rsquo;s eye&mdash;of a sneakish
person manipulating a slide.</p>

<p>No human being had witnessed the act, and he
was cocksure that no higher power existed to see it;
but for all that it worried him. Memories are not
dead things, but alive; they dwindle in disuse, but
they harden and develop in all sorts of queer ways if
they are being continually fretted. Curiously enough,
though at the time he perceived clearly that the shifting
was accidental, as the days wore on, his memory
became confused about it, until at last he was not
sure&mdash;although he assured himself that he <em>was</em> sure&mdash;whether
the movement had been absolutely involuntary.
Then it is possible that Hill&rsquo;s dietary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
was conducive to morbid conscientiousness; a breakfast
frequently eaten in a hurry, a midday bun, and,
at such hours after five as chanced to be convenient,
such meat as his means determined, usually in a
chophouse in a back street off the Brompton Road.
Occasionally he treated himself to threepenny or
ninepenny classics, and they usually represented a
suppression of potatoes or chops. It is indisputable
that outbreaks of self-abasement and emotional
revival have a distinct relation to periods of scarcity.
But apart from this influence on the feelings, there
was in Hill a distinct aversion to falsity that the
blasphemous Landport cobbler had inculcated by
strap and tongue from his earliest years. Of one
fact about professed atheists I am convinced; they
may be&mdash;they usually are&mdash;fools, void of subtlety,
revilers of holy institutions, brutal speakers, and mischievous
knaves, but they lie with difficulty. If it
were not so, if they had the faintest grasp of the
idea of compromise, they would simply be liberal
churchmen. And, moreover, this memory poisoned
his regard for Miss Haysman. For she now so evidently
preferred him to Wedderburn that he felt sure
he cared for her, and began reciprocating her attentions
by timid marks of personal regard; at one time
he even bought a bunch of violets, carried it about in
his pocket, and produced it, with a stumbling explanation,
withered and dead, in the gallery of old iron.
It poisoned, too, the denunciation of capitalist dishonesty
that had been one of his life&rsquo;s pleasures.
And, lastly, it poisoned his triumph in Wedderburn.
Previously he had been Wedderburn&rsquo;s superior in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
own eyes, and had raged simply at a want of recognition.
Now he began to fret at the darker suspicion
of positive inferiority. He fancied he found justifications
for his position in Browning, but they vanished
on analysis. At last&mdash;moved, curiously enough, by
exactly the same motive forces that had resulted in
his dishonesty&mdash;he went to Professor Bindon, and
made a clean breast of the whole affair. As Hill
was a paid student, Professor Bindon did not ask
him to sit down, and he stood before the professor&rsquo;s
desk as he made his confession.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a curious story,&rdquo; said Professor Bindon,
slowly realising how the thing reflected on himself,
and then letting his anger rise,&mdash;&ldquo;A most
remarkable story. I can&rsquo;t understand your doing
it, and I can&rsquo;t understand this avowal. You&rsquo;re a
type of student&mdash;Cambridge men would never dream&mdash;I
suppose I ought to have thought&mdash;Why <em>did</em> you
cheat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t&mdash;cheat,&rdquo; said Hill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you have just been telling me you did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought I explained&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Either you cheated or you did not cheat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said my motion was involuntary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not a metaphysician, I am a servant of
science&mdash;of fact. You were told not to move the
slip. You did move the slip. If that is not cheating&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I was a cheat,&rdquo; said Hill, with the note of
hysterics in his voice, &ldquo;should I come here and tell
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your repentance, of course, does you credit,&rdquo; said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
Professor Bindon, &ldquo;but it does not alter the original
facts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; said Hill, giving in in utter self-abasement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even now you cause an enormous amount of
trouble. The examination list will have to be
revised.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose so, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose so? Of course it must be revised. And
I don&rsquo;t see how I can conscientiously pass you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not pass me?&rdquo; said Hill. &ldquo;Fail me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the rule in all examinations. Or where
should we be? What else did you expect? You
don&rsquo;t want to shirk the consequences of your own
acts?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought, perhaps&rdquo;&mdash;said Hill. And then, &ldquo;Fail
me? I thought, as I told you, you would simply
deduct the marks given for that slip.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; said Bindon. &ldquo;Besides, it would
still leave you above Wedderburn. Deduct only the
marks&mdash;Preposterous! The Departmental Regulations
distinctly say&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s my own admission, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Regulations say nothing whatever of the
manner in which the matter comes to light. They
simply provide&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will ruin me. If I fail this examination, they
won&rsquo;t renew my scholarship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should have thought of that before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, sir, consider all my circumstances&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot consider anything. Professors in this
College are machines. The Regulations will not even
let us recommend our students for appointments. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
am a machine, and you have worked me. I have to
do&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very hard, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Possibly it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I am to be failed this examination, I might as
well go home at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is as you think proper.&rdquo; Bindon&rsquo;s voice
softened a little; he perceived he had been unjust,
and, provided he did not contradict himself, he was
disposed to amelioration, &ldquo;As a private person,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;I think this confession of yours goes far to
mitigate your offence. But you have set the machinery
in motion, and now it must take its course. I&mdash;I am
really sorry you gave way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A wave of emotion prevented Hill from answering.
Suddenly, very vividly, he saw the heavily-lined face
of the old Landport cobbler, his father. &ldquo;Good God!
What a fool I have been!&rdquo; he said hotly and abruptly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; said Bindon, &ldquo;that it will be a lesson to
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But, curiously enough, they were not thinking of
quite the same indiscretion.</p>

<p>There was a pause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would like a day to think, sir, and then I will
let you know&mdash;about going home, I mean,&rdquo; said Hill,
moving towards the door.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>The next day Hill&rsquo;s place was vacant. The spectacled
girl in green was, as usual, first with the news.
Wedderburn and Miss Haysman were talking of a
performance of <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">The Meistersingers</i> when she came up
to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you heard?&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heard what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was cheating in the examination.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cheating!&rdquo; said Wedderburn, with his face suddenly
hot. &ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That slide&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Moved? Never!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was. That slide that we weren&rsquo;t to move&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said Wedderburn. &ldquo;Why! How
could they find out? Who do they say&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was Mr. Hill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Hill!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Hill!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not&mdash;surely not the immaculate Hill?&rdquo; said
Wedderburn, recovering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; said Miss Haysman. &ldquo;How
do you know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I <em>didn&rsquo;t</em>,&rdquo; said the girl in spectacles. &ldquo;But I know
it now for a fact. Mr. Hill went and confessed to
Professor Bindon himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; said Wedderburn. &ldquo;Hill of all people.
But I am always inclined to distrust these philanthropists-on-principle&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you quite sure?&rdquo; said Miss Haysman, with a
catch in her breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite. It&rsquo;s dreadful, isn&rsquo;t it? But, you know,
what can you expect? His father is a cobbler.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Miss Haysman astonished the girl in spectacles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care. I will not believe it,&rdquo; she said,
flushing darkly under her warm-tinted skin. &ldquo;I will
not believe it until he has told me so himself&mdash;face to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
face. I would scarcely believe it then,&rdquo; and abruptly
she turned her back on the girl in spectacles, and
walked to her own place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true, all the same,&rdquo; said the girl in spectacles,
peering and smiling at Wedderburn.</p>

<p>But Wedderburn did not answer her. She was
indeed one of those people who seem destined to
make unanswered remarks.</p>
